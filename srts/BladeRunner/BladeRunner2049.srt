1
00:05:00,675 --> 00:05:04,195
I hope you don't mind me
taking the liberty.

2
00:05:06,555 --> 00:05:08,812
I was careful
not to drag in any dirt.

3
00:05:08,961 --> 00:05:11,271
I don't mind the dirt.

4
00:05:11,988 --> 00:05:14,256
I do mind

5
00:05:15,719 --> 00:05:17,895
unannounced visits.

6
00:05:18,435 --> 00:05:21,075
You police?

7
00:05:23,604 --> 00:05:25,468
Are you Sapper Morton?
Civic number NK68514?

8
00:05:26,711 --> 00:05:31,450
I'm a farmer.

9
00:05:31,516 --> 00:05:33,446
I saw that.

10
00:05:33,690 --> 00:05:35,227
What do you farm?

11
00:05:35,755 --> 00:05:37,696
It's a protein farm.

12
00:05:44,721 --> 00:05:46,738
Wallace design.

13
00:05:47,211 --> 00:05:49,308
Is that what I smell?

14
00:05:50,856 --> 00:05:52,550
Grow that just for me.

15
00:05:53,102 --> 00:05:55,008
Garlic.

16
00:05:55,941 --> 00:05:57,631
Garlic.

17
00:05:57,632 --> 00:11:43,363
Go on, try some.

18
00:05:59,140 --> 00:06:01,033
No, thank you.

19
00:06:01,835 --> 00:06:03,529
I prefer to keep
an empty stomach

20
00:06:05,317 --> 00:06:09,695
until the hard part
of the day is done.

21
00:06:12,223 --> 00:06:13,952
How long you been here?

22
00:06:13,977 --> 00:06:15,614
Since 2020.

23
00:06:16,874 --> 00:06:19,714
But you haven't always
been a farmer, have you?

24
00:06:21,332 --> 00:06:22,946
Your bag.

25
00:06:23,142 --> 00:06:25,331
It's colonial medical use.

26
00:06:25,442 --> 00:06:27,158
Military issue.

27
00:06:29,529 --> 00:06:32,380
Where were you? Calantha?

28
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:38,491
Must have been brutal.

29
00:06:38,952 --> 00:06:41,180
Plan on taking me in?

30
00:06:43,870 --> 00:06:45,811
Let them take a look inside?

31
00:06:46,062 --> 00:06:47,557
Mr. Morton,

32
00:06:48,510 --> 00:06:51,000
if taking you in
is an option,

33
00:06:55,157 --> 00:06:58,046
I would much prefer that
to the alternative.

34
00:06:59,263 --> 00:07:02,484
I'm sure you knew
it would be someone in time.

35
00:07:04,217 --> 00:07:06,299
I'm sorry it had to be me.

36
00:07:09,935 --> 00:07:11,846
Good as any.

37
00:07:16,589 --> 00:07:18,581
Now, if you don't mind,

38
00:07:19,170 --> 00:07:22,261
if you could just look up
and to the left, please.

39
00:08:18,907 --> 00:08:20,995
Please don't get up.

40
00:08:31,842 --> 00:08:35,110
How's it feel
killing your own kind?

41
00:08:38,769 --> 00:08:42,276
I don't retire my own kind
because we don't run.

42
00:08:44,280 --> 00:08:46,121
Only older models do.

43
00:08:46,146 --> 00:08:50,637
And you new models
are happy scraping the shit

44
00:08:55,125 --> 00:08:57,809
because you've never
seen a miracle.

45
00:09:38,915 --> 00:09:41,007
Just photograph everything.

46
00:09:52,644 --> 00:09:54,537
Madam, please.

47
00:09:54,748 --> 00:09:57,613
Incoming LAPD re-codec hash.

48
00:10:00,551 --> 00:10:03,539
You're hurt.
I'm not payin' for that.

49
00:10:04,334 --> 00:10:06,525
-I'll glue it.
-And?

50
00:10:12,542 --> 00:10:14,482
One of the tail-end Nexus 8s.

51
00:10:14,513 --> 00:10:17,381
He looks like he could
take your head off.

52
00:10:17,382 --> 00:10:18,381
He tried.

53
00:10:18,406 --> 00:10:20,545
He went AWOL after Calantha

54
00:10:20,604 --> 00:10:23,982
with a few more in his outfit
I wouldn't mind closin' out.

55
00:10:24,210 --> 00:10:26,501
-Just him?
-Just him.

56
00:10:27,067 --> 00:10:29,408
Come on home
for your baseline.

57
00:10:33,093 --> 00:10:34,899
One moment, madam.

58
00:11:22,494 --> 00:11:24,984
30 meters to maximum depth.

59
00:11:40,565 --> 00:11:42,144
What is that?

60
00:11:47,356 --> 00:11:49,341
I'll send a dig team.

61
00:11:50,213 --> 00:11:52,162
Come on home before the storm.

62
00:13:09,664 --> 00:13:13,345
Officer KD6-3.7.

63
00:13:13,370 --> 00:13:15,462
-Let's begin. Ready?
- Yes, sir.

64
00:13:16,631 --> 00:13:18,264
Recite your baseline.

65
00:13:18,289 --> 00:13:21,476
And blood-black
nothingness began to spin

66
00:13:23,169 --> 00:13:25,826
A system of cells
interlinked within cells

67
00:13:25,851 --> 00:13:28,147
interlinked within cells

68
00:13:28,148 --> 00:13:29,147
interlinked within one stem.

69
00:13:29,172 --> 00:13:30,977
Fuck off, skin-job.

70
00:13:32,650 --> 00:13:36,401
And dreadfully distinct
Against the dark,

71
00:13:36,402 --> 00:13:37,401
a tall white fountain played.

72
00:13:38,564 --> 00:13:39,857
- Cells.
- Cells.

73
00:13:39,882 --> 00:13:41,789
Have you ever been
in an institution?

74
00:13:41,814 --> 00:13:43,106
-Cells.
- Cells.

75
00:13:43,107 --> 00:13:44,400
Do they
keep you in a cell?

76
00:13:44,401 --> 00:13:45,694
-Cells.
- Cells.

77
00:13:45,695 --> 00:13:47,581
When you're not
performing your duties,

78
00:13:47,582 --> 00:13:48,581
do they keep you
in a little box?

79
00:13:48,582 --> 00:13:49,675
-Cells.
- Cells.

80
00:13:49,676 --> 00:13:51,567
- Interlinked.
- Interlinked.

81
00:13:51,568 --> 00:13:53,408
What's it like to hold
the hand of someone you love?

82
00:13:53,409 --> 00:13:54,901
-Interlinked.
- Interlinked.

83
00:13:54,902 --> 00:13:56,742
Did they teach you
how to feel finger to finger?

84
00:13:56,743 --> 00:13:58,136
-Interlinked.
- Interlinked.

85
00:13:58,137 --> 00:13:59,828
Do you long for having
your heart interlinked?

86
00:13:59,829 --> 00:14:01,221
-Interlinked.
- Interlinked.

87
00:14:01,222 --> 00:14:03,013
Do you dream
about being interlinked?

88
00:14:03,014 --> 00:14:03,809
Interlinked.

89
00:14:03,810 --> 00:14:05,600
What's it like to hold
your child in your arms?

90
00:14:05,601 --> 00:14:06,845
-Interlinked.
- Interlinked.

91
00:14:06,846 --> 00:14:08,586
Do you feel that there's
a part of you that's missing?

92
00:14:08,587 --> 00:14:09,781
-Interlinked.
- Interlinked.

93
00:14:09,782 --> 00:14:12,468
- Within cells interlinked.
- Within cells interlinked.

94
00:14:12,469 --> 00:14:13,901
Why don't you
say that three times.

95
00:14:13,902 --> 00:14:14,901
Within cells interlinked.

96
00:14:14,928 --> 00:14:18,003
Within cells interlinked.

97
00:14:18,028 --> 00:14:20,010
Within cells interlinked.
Within cells interlinked.

98
00:14:22,965 --> 00:14:24,560
We're done.

99
00:14:25,844 --> 00:14:27,538
Constant "K."

100
00:14:28,041 --> 00:14:30,082
You can pick up your bonus.

101
00:14:31,218 --> 00:14:32,825
Thank you, sir.

102
00:14:32,887 --> 00:14:34,862
Caution, keep clear.

103
00:14:35,977 --> 00:14:38,043
Caution, keep clear.

104
00:14:41,035 --> 00:14:43,717
Connect to off-world

105
00:14:43,718 --> 00:14:44,717
any time, any place.

106
00:14:44,718 --> 00:14:47,205
Packages start at 20 minutes.

107
00:14:47,206 --> 00:14:49,000
Many options available.

108
00:14:53,738 --> 00:14:57,024
Joi goes anywhere
you want her to go.

109
00:14:57,520 --> 00:15:01,555
Connect to
off-world any time, any place.

110
00:15:44,936 --> 00:15:48,454
"K"? I didn't hear you.
You're early.

111
00:15:48,519 --> 00:15:50,511
You want me to come back?

112
00:15:50,739 --> 00:15:53,037
Just go scrub.

113
00:15:54,929 --> 00:15:56,661
Yes, ma'am.

114
00:15:58,368 --> 00:16:00,162
How was your meeting?

115
00:16:00,516 --> 00:16:02,541
The usual.

116
00:16:03,650 --> 00:16:05,643
How was your day?

117
00:16:06,398 --> 00:16:09,591
I'm getting cabin fever.

118
00:16:13,189 --> 00:16:15,480
99.9% detoxified water.

119
00:16:16,031 --> 00:16:18,023
I had an accident at work.
I think I ruined my shirt.

120
00:16:18,456 --> 00:16:20,426
I'm sure
I can fix that for you.

121
00:16:20,451 --> 00:16:22,456
Let me take a look at it.

122
00:16:28,358 --> 00:16:30,052
I need a drink.

123
00:16:30,937 --> 00:16:33,625
Do you want a drink first?

124
00:16:33,626 --> 00:16:34,625
Mmm-hmm.
Pour me one, will ya?

125
00:16:36,334 --> 00:16:37,928
I'm trying a new recipe.

126
00:16:38,038 --> 00:16:40,040
I just need
a bit more practice.

127
00:16:40,065 --> 00:16:41,694
Don't fuss.

128
00:16:44,208 --> 00:16:46,473
I should have
marinated it longer.

129
00:16:46,595 --> 00:16:48,403
I hope it isn't dry.

130
00:16:50,516 --> 00:16:54,206
Did you know
this song was released

131
00:16:54,207 --> 00:16:55,206
in 1966 on Reprise Records?

132
00:16:55,823 --> 00:16:58,054
It was number one
on the charts.

133
00:17:03,142 --> 00:17:04,726
It won't be much longer.

134
00:17:04,751 --> 00:17:07,322
Just putting on
the finishing touches.

135
00:17:11,177 --> 00:17:15,055
Okay, it's ready.
I hope you're gonna like it.

136
00:17:15,080 --> 00:17:17,038
I told you not to fuss.

137
00:17:18,842 --> 00:17:20,661
And yet...

138
00:17:23,246 --> 00:17:25,975
Voilأ ! Bon appأ©tit.

139
00:17:28,634 --> 00:17:30,686
I missed you, baby sweet.

140
00:17:32,531 --> 00:17:34,523
Honey, it's beautiful.

141
00:17:34,752 --> 00:17:36,616
Just put your feet up.

142
00:17:37,289 --> 00:17:39,082
Relax.

143
00:17:57,113 --> 00:17:59,105
Was a day, hmm?

144
00:18:00,318 --> 00:18:02,099
It was a day.

145
00:18:02,914 --> 00:18:04,876
Would you read to me?

146
00:18:06,212 --> 00:18:07,766
It'll make you feel better.

147
00:18:07,835 --> 00:18:11,265
-You hate that book.
-I don't wanna read either.

148
00:18:12,993 --> 00:18:14,320
Let's dance.

149
00:18:14,345 --> 00:18:16,901
Do you wanna dance, or do you
wanna open your present?

150
00:18:16,941 --> 00:18:18,536
What present?

151
00:18:22,357 --> 00:18:23,865
This one.

152
00:18:23,963 --> 00:18:25,615
What's the occasion?

153
00:18:25,746 --> 00:18:27,638
Let's just say

154
00:18:27,971 --> 00:18:31,245
-it's our anniversary.
-Is it?

155
00:18:32,252 --> 00:18:36,830
No, but let's just
say that it is.

156
00:18:37,459 --> 00:18:38,854
Okay?

157
00:18:42,396 --> 00:18:44,123
Happy anniversary.

158
00:18:45,199 --> 00:18:46,992
An emanator.

159
00:19:29,473 --> 00:19:30,909
Thank you.

160
00:19:30,949 --> 00:19:35,032
Honey, you can go anywhere
you want in the world now.

161
00:19:36,141 --> 00:19:38,258
Where do you wanna go first?

162
00:21:52,112 --> 00:21:54,615
I'm so happy
when I'm with you.

163
00:21:56,743 --> 00:21:58,911
You don't have to say that.

164
00:22:30,058 --> 00:22:32,839
The dig's come through.
We have a new lead.

165
00:22:33,536 --> 00:22:35,176
Get down here.

166
00:22:48,673 --> 00:22:52,846
Carbon read: 14.6 GPH.

167
00:23:12,733 --> 00:23:16,176
Your box
is a military footlocker

168
00:23:16,177 --> 00:23:17,176
issued to Sapper Morton,

169
00:23:17,511 --> 00:23:20,368
creatively repurposed
as an ossuary:

170
00:23:20,439 --> 00:23:22,056
a box of bones.

171
00:23:22,467 --> 00:23:24,459
Nothin' else in it but hair.

172
00:23:25,605 --> 00:23:28,886
The soil samples indicate that

173
00:23:28,887 --> 00:23:29,886
she's been buried
for 30 years.

174
00:23:30,451 --> 00:23:33,729
Bones all dismantled,
fully cleaned,

175
00:23:33,730 --> 00:23:34,729
meticulously laid to rest.

176
00:23:34,791 --> 00:23:36,386
"She"?

177
00:23:37,651 --> 00:23:39,568
Cause of death, Coco?

178
00:23:50,119 --> 00:23:53,743
No breaks,
no sign of trauma, except

179
00:23:54,527 --> 00:23:57,018
a fracture
through the ilium.

180
00:23:57,739 --> 00:24:00,684
It's a narrow birth canal.
Baby must have got stuck.

181
00:24:00,740 --> 00:24:03,653
- She was pregnant?
- Hmm.

182
00:24:03,918 --> 00:24:06,610
So he didn't kill her?

183
00:24:06,611 --> 00:24:07,610
Mmm. She died in childbirth.

184
00:24:09,422 --> 00:24:10,948
What's that?

185
00:24:12,002 --> 00:24:13,542
Go back.

186
00:24:14,307 --> 00:24:15,831
Closer.

187
00:24:17,164 --> 00:24:18,758
Closer.

188
00:24:21,468 --> 00:24:23,122
What's that?

189
00:24:24,704 --> 00:24:26,097
Huh.

190
00:24:26,191 --> 00:24:29,608
Notching in the iliac crest.

191
00:24:30,137 --> 00:24:33,440
It's fine-point,
like a scalpel.

192
00:24:34,446 --> 00:24:37,097
That looks like
an emergency C-section.

193
00:24:37,563 --> 00:24:41,048
The cuts are clean.
No sign of a struggle.

194
00:24:41,818 --> 00:24:43,641
He was a combat medic.

195
00:24:44,373 --> 00:24:46,670
Maybe he tried to save her
and he just couldn't.

196
00:24:46,709 --> 00:24:48,758
He didn't seem like
the saving type.

197
00:24:48,783 --> 00:24:51,217
He went to the trouble
of burying her.

198
00:24:51,425 --> 00:24:53,566
A sentimental skin-job.

199
00:24:55,522 --> 00:24:56,956
Sorry.

200
00:24:57,367 --> 00:24:59,239
So where's the kid?

201
00:25:00,628 --> 00:25:02,510
You scan the whole field?

202
00:25:02,549 --> 00:25:04,166
Just dirt and worms.

203
00:25:04,167 --> 00:25:05,166
No other bodies.

204
00:25:05,191 --> 00:25:06,822
Maybe he ate it.

205
00:25:55,688 --> 00:25:57,637
That's not possible.

206
00:26:00,106 --> 00:26:01,999
She was a Replicant.

207
00:26:04,562 --> 00:26:06,224
Pregnant.

208
00:26:15,185 --> 00:26:19,261
The world is built on a wall.

209
00:26:19,262 --> 00:26:20,261
It separates kind.

210
00:26:21,388 --> 00:26:23,973
Tell either side
there's no wall,

211
00:26:23,974 --> 00:26:24,973
you bought a war.

212
00:26:25,603 --> 00:26:27,270
Or a slaughter.

213
00:26:30,996 --> 00:26:32,989
So, what you saw

214
00:26:34,985 --> 00:26:36,837
didn't happen.

215
00:26:38,568 --> 00:26:40,036
Yes, madam.

216
00:26:40,061 --> 00:26:42,946
It is my job to keep order.

217
00:26:43,062 --> 00:26:45,951
That's what we do here.
We keep order.

218
00:26:47,825 --> 00:26:49,519
You want it gone?

219
00:26:50,986 --> 00:26:52,677
Erase everything.

220
00:26:52,726 --> 00:26:54,544
Even the child?

221
00:26:54,545 --> 00:26:55,544
All trace.

222
00:26:59,778 --> 00:27:01,947
You have anything more to say?

223
00:27:03,613 --> 00:27:06,673
I've never retired something
that was born before.

224
00:27:07,664 --> 00:27:09,552
What's the difference?

225
00:27:13,467 --> 00:27:15,957
To be born is to have a soul,
I guess.

226
00:27:17,034 --> 00:27:18,927
Are you telling me no?

227
00:27:19,907 --> 00:27:22,458
I wasn't aware
that was an option, madam.

228
00:27:22,494 --> 00:27:24,130
Attaboy.

229
00:27:27,196 --> 00:27:28,592
Hey.

230
00:27:28,773 --> 00:27:30,964
You've been getting on fine
without one.

231
00:27:31,355 --> 00:27:32,910
What's that, madam?

232
00:27:33,160 --> 00:27:34,752
A soul.

233
00:28:21,484 --> 00:28:26,462
And you new models
are happy scraping the shit

234
00:28:28,573 --> 00:28:31,119
because you've never seen
a miracle.

235
00:28:55,122 --> 00:28:57,689
Just checking in
on an old serial number.

236
00:29:02,579 --> 00:29:04,472
Confirmation DNA?

237
00:29:05,394 --> 00:29:07,168
I got hair.

238
00:29:24,191 --> 00:29:27,632
Oh! An old one.

239
00:29:28,295 --> 00:29:30,164
Pre-Blackout. Huh.

240
00:29:31,344 --> 00:29:33,536
That's gonna be tough.

241
00:29:34,497 --> 00:29:36,983
Not much from then.

242
00:29:36,984 --> 00:29:37,983
And what's there is

243
00:29:38,638 --> 00:29:40,432
thick milky.

244
00:29:41,312 --> 00:29:44,197
You can customize them
as much as you'd like.

245
00:29:44,573 --> 00:29:46,963
As human
as you want them to be.

246
00:29:47,454 --> 00:29:50,751
But your operation is strictly
a drill site, isn't it?

247
00:29:51,066 --> 00:29:54,448
I wouldn't waste your money
on intelligence,

248
00:29:54,449 --> 00:29:55,448
attachment or appeal.

249
00:29:56,157 --> 00:29:59,874
Unless you'd like to add some
pleasure models to your order.

250
00:30:13,196 --> 00:30:16,373
Would it be possible to
reschedule this call, please?

251
00:30:18,835 --> 00:30:21,288
Everyone remembers

252
00:30:21,289 --> 00:30:22,288
where they were
at the Blackout. You?

253
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:24,672
That was a little
before my time.

254
00:30:24,728 --> 00:30:27,210
Mmm. I was home with my folks,

255
00:30:27,344 --> 00:30:30,014
then ten days of darkness.
Every machine stopped cold.

256
00:30:30,039 --> 00:30:32,556
When the lights came back,
we were wiped clean.

257
00:30:32,581 --> 00:30:36,417
Photos, files, every bit of
data... Ffft! Gone.

258
00:30:36,450 --> 00:30:38,435
Bank records, too.

259
00:30:38,436 --> 00:30:39,435
Didn't mind that.

260
00:30:39,538 --> 00:30:41,627
It's funny it's only paper
that lasted.

261
00:30:41,651 --> 00:30:44,518
I mean, we had
everything on drives.

262
00:30:44,519 --> 00:30:45,517
Everything, everything,
everything! Huh.

263
00:30:46,903 --> 00:30:49,991
My mom still cries
over the lost baby pictures.

264
00:30:50,127 --> 00:30:52,426
Well, it's a shame. You

265
00:30:52,427 --> 00:30:53,426
-must have been adorable.
-Hmm... Ah.

266
00:30:53,513 --> 00:30:55,544
Uh...

267
00:30:59,674 --> 00:31:02,463
Pretty fractured.
Not much on it.

268
00:31:03,426 --> 00:31:05,966
One of the last gens,
pre-Prohibition.

269
00:31:06,213 --> 00:31:09,466
Standard issue.
Made by Tyrell.

270
00:31:10,110 --> 00:31:11,645
And?

271
00:31:11,886 --> 00:31:13,974
Unremarkable.

272
00:31:13,975 --> 00:31:14,974
"Unremarkable"?

273
00:31:15,147 --> 00:31:18,087
There must be something
else we can find for him.

274
00:31:25,452 --> 00:31:28,042
Another prodigal
serial number returns.

275
00:31:29,573 --> 00:31:32,461
A 30-year-old open case
finally closed.

276
00:31:33,010 --> 00:31:34,849
Thank you, officer.

277
00:31:35,774 --> 00:31:38,189
I'm here for Mr. Wallace.
I'm Luv.

278
00:31:40,345 --> 00:31:42,080
He named you.

279
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:44,556
Must be special.

280
00:31:45,146 --> 00:31:47,072
I'm here for Mr. Wallace.

281
00:31:47,073 --> 00:31:48,072
Follow me.

282
00:31:54,486 --> 00:31:57,972
The ancient models
give the entire endeavor
a bad name.

283
00:31:59,264 --> 00:32:03,944
What a gift, don't you think,
from Mr. Wallace to the world?

284
00:32:07,053 --> 00:32:09,808
The outer colonies
would never have flourished

285
00:32:09,809 --> 00:32:10,808
had he not bought Tyrell,

286
00:32:10,856 --> 00:32:12,948
revivified the technology.

287
00:32:13,795 --> 00:32:15,887
To say the least
of what we do.

288
00:32:19,217 --> 00:32:21,264
I see you're also a customer.

289
00:32:21,583 --> 00:32:24,100
Are you satisfied
with our product?

290
00:32:24,290 --> 00:32:27,974
She's very realistic.
Thank you.

291
00:32:28,800 --> 00:32:31,258
Here. All the junk is in here.

292
00:32:31,579 --> 00:32:34,468
Lucky for you,
Mr. Wallace is a data hoarder.

293
00:32:46,977 --> 00:32:49,216
No one's been
down here in ages.

294
00:32:52,155 --> 00:32:53,981
Sorry about that.

295
00:33:05,322 --> 00:33:08,955
All our memory bearings
from the time.

296
00:33:08,956 --> 00:33:09,955
They were all damaged
in the Blackout.

297
00:33:10,304 --> 00:33:12,799
But there are
sometimes fragments.

298
00:33:28,592 --> 00:33:30,126
You got a little boy.

299
00:33:30,118 --> 00:33:31,843
He shows you
his butterfly collection,

300
00:33:31,844 --> 00:33:32,843
plus the killing jar.

301
00:33:32,875 --> 00:33:34,811
I'd take him
to the doctor.

302
00:33:37,218 --> 00:33:39,590
There's a wasp
crawling on your arm.

303
00:33:39,591 --> 00:33:40,590
I'd kill it.

304
00:33:42,626 --> 00:33:45,728
You're reading a magazine.

305
00:33:45,729 --> 00:33:46,728
You come across a full-page
nude photo of a girl.

306
00:33:46,759 --> 00:33:48,921
Is this testing
whether I'm a Replicant

307
00:33:48,922 --> 00:33:49,921
or a lesbian, Mr. Deckard?

308
00:33:49,946 --> 00:33:52,265
Just answer
the questions, please.

309
00:33:55,770 --> 00:33:59,452
It was unclear what she was,
at least to someone.

310
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:01,209
This was a test.

311
00:34:01,797 --> 00:34:03,989
We were difficult
to spot then.

312
00:34:05,694 --> 00:34:08,933
Was there anything unusual
about how you found her?

313
00:34:09,083 --> 00:34:11,700
To warrant an official
investigation?

314
00:34:14,132 --> 00:34:17,272
You know how people are
about old serial numbers.

315
00:34:17,783 --> 00:34:20,396
Everyone just sleeps better

316
00:34:20,397 --> 00:34:21,396
when they know
where they got to.

317
00:34:24,152 --> 00:34:25,727
She likes him.

318
00:34:26,961 --> 00:34:28,469
Who?

319
00:34:28,630 --> 00:34:31,021
This Officer Deckard.

320
00:34:32,214 --> 00:34:34,219
She's trying to provoke him.

321
00:34:37,611 --> 00:34:40,997
It is invigorating being asked
personal questions.

322
00:34:41,294 --> 00:34:42,988
Makes one feel

323
00:34:44,219 --> 00:34:46,159
desired.

324
00:34:46,982 --> 00:34:49,189
Do you enjoy
your work, officer?

325
00:34:53,591 --> 00:34:56,014
Please thank Mr. Wallace
for your time.

326
00:35:08,284 --> 00:35:10,969
You worked
with Officer Deckard

327
00:35:10,970 --> 00:35:11,969
back in the day.

328
00:35:12,723 --> 00:35:14,791
What can you tell me
about him?

329
00:35:15,287 --> 00:35:17,479
He liked to work alone.

330
00:35:18,465 --> 00:35:20,310
So did I.

331
00:35:22,271 --> 00:35:25,458
So we worked together
to keep it that way.

332
00:35:26,706 --> 00:35:28,309
That was it.

333
00:35:29,294 --> 00:35:31,613
Anything else
you can tell me?

334
00:35:33,230 --> 00:35:35,581
He wasn't long for this world.

335
00:35:37,831 --> 00:35:39,445
How so?

336
00:35:41,574 --> 00:35:43,965
Something in his eyes.

337
00:35:47,063 --> 00:35:49,553
Any idea how I could
contact him?

338
00:35:49,849 --> 00:35:51,373
None.

339
00:35:52,736 --> 00:35:55,027
He's nyugdأ­jas.

340
00:35:58,120 --> 00:35:59,643
Retired.

341
00:36:00,995 --> 00:36:02,527
What happened?

342
00:36:02,552 --> 00:36:05,042
Probably got what he wanted.

343
00:36:07,276 --> 00:36:09,069
To be alone.

344
00:36:33,912 --> 00:36:35,905
Welcome back, sir.

345
00:36:37,242 --> 00:36:40,033
You wanted to review
the new model, sir,

346
00:36:40,034 --> 00:36:41,033
before shipment?

347
00:36:41,957 --> 00:36:45,365
An angel
should never enter

348
00:36:45,366 --> 00:36:46,365
the kingdom of heaven

349
00:36:46,850 --> 00:36:48,717
without a gift.

350
00:36:50,962 --> 00:36:54,448
Can you at least pronounce,
"A child is born"?

351
00:36:56,982 --> 00:36:58,607
Hmm.

352
00:37:05,366 --> 00:37:07,169
A new model.

353
00:37:14,661 --> 00:37:17,051
Well, let us see her, then.

354
00:38:05,464 --> 00:38:08,113
The first thought

355
00:38:10,698 --> 00:38:12,691
one tends to fear,

356
00:38:13,932 --> 00:38:15,924
to preserve the clay.

357
00:38:18,525 --> 00:38:20,418
It's fascinating.

358
00:38:21,444 --> 00:38:24,187
Before we even know
what we are,

359
00:38:26,462 --> 00:38:28,187
we fear to lose it.

360
00:38:29,850 --> 00:38:31,591
Happy birthday.

361
00:38:41,029 --> 00:38:42,515
Now, let's have a look at you.

362
00:39:34,515 --> 00:39:37,019
We make angels

363
00:39:38,019 --> 00:39:42,223
in the service
of civilization.

364
00:39:42,223 --> 00:39:45,493
Yes, there were
bad angels once.

365
00:39:45,493 --> 00:39:47,896
I make good angels now.

366
00:39:33,843 --> 00:39:38,040
That is how I took us
to nine new worlds.

367
00:39:41,106 --> 00:39:42,601
Nine.

368
00:39:44,160 --> 00:39:47,715
A child can count to nine
on fingers.

369
00:39:47,744 --> 00:39:50,582
We should own the stars.

370
00:39:50,614 --> 00:39:52,191
Yes, sir.

371
00:39:55,033 --> 00:39:57,481
Every leap
of civilization

372
00:39:57,506 --> 00:40:00,162
was built off the back
of a disposable workforce.

373
00:40:00,193 --> 00:40:03,199
We lost our stomach
for slaves

374
00:40:03,435 --> 00:40:05,510
unless engineered.

375
00:40:08,668 --> 00:40:10,959
But I can only make so many.

376
00:40:16,663 --> 00:40:19,054
That barren pasture,

377
00:40:19,779 --> 00:40:22,029
empty

378
00:40:22,030 --> 00:40:23,029
and salted...

379
00:40:24,986 --> 00:40:26,480
...right here.

380
00:40:28,577 --> 00:40:31,963
The dead space
between the stars.

381
00:40:33,993 --> 00:40:37,180
And this, the seat that
we must change for heaven.

382
00:40:42,174 --> 00:40:46,760
I cannot breed them.
So help me, I have tried.

383
00:40:47,562 --> 00:40:50,646
We need more Replicants
than can ever be assembled.

384
00:40:50,711 --> 00:40:54,317
Millions, so we can be
trillions more.

385
00:40:56,147 --> 00:40:59,110
We could storm Eden
and retake her.

386
00:41:11,474 --> 00:41:13,965
Tyrell's final trick:

387
00:41:14,460 --> 00:41:16,453
Procreation.

388
00:41:16,550 --> 00:41:19,936
Perfected, then lost.

389
00:41:21,029 --> 00:41:23,420
But there is a child.

390
00:41:26,006 --> 00:41:27,899
Bring it to me.

391
00:41:28,196 --> 00:41:29,889
Sir.

392
00:41:37,892 --> 00:41:40,084
The best angel of all.

393
00:41:41,459 --> 00:41:43,053
Aren't you, Luv?

394
00:43:00,983 --> 00:43:03,476
The man with the green jacket.

395
00:43:03,477 --> 50:43:06,515
The one who killed Sapper.
Find out what he knows.

396
00:43:25,744 --> 00:43:27,240
Hi.

397
00:43:28,202 --> 00:43:30,493
Hello, hello, A-Boy.

398
00:43:30,714 --> 00:43:32,508
You alone?

399
00:43:38,408 --> 00:43:41,509
It's okay.
It's fine.

400
00:43:47,044 --> 00:43:49,079
Wanna buy a lady a cigarette?

401
00:43:55,704 --> 00:43:57,937
Oh, you don't even smile.

402
00:44:00,182 --> 00:44:02,171
Didn't you hear your friends?

403
00:44:02,534 --> 00:44:04,540
Don't you know what I am?

404
00:44:04,649 --> 00:44:06,103
Yeah.

405
00:44:06,431 --> 00:44:08,424
Guy eating rice.

406
00:44:09,638 --> 00:44:11,145
What's that?

407
00:44:12,257 --> 00:44:13,817
It's a tree.

408
00:44:14,147 --> 00:44:16,936
Oh. Never seen a tree before.

409
00:44:18,796 --> 00:44:20,438
It's pretty.

410
00:44:22,318 --> 00:44:24,022
It's dead.

411
00:44:25,464 --> 00:44:29,945
Now, who keeps a dead tree?

412
00:44:33,246 --> 00:44:34,753
Hmm?

413
00:44:37,085 --> 00:44:38,975
You're not gonna kill me,
are you?

414
00:44:39,016 --> 00:44:42,402
Depends.
What's your model number?

415
00:44:42,601 --> 00:44:45,479
Why don't you look under
my eye and find out.

416
00:44:47,752 --> 00:44:49,128
Oh!

417
00:44:49,851 --> 00:44:51,933
You don't like real girls.

418
00:44:55,089 --> 00:44:57,978
Well, I'm always here.

419
00:48:36,877 --> 00:48:38,584
Hi.

420
00:48:40,017 --> 00:48:41,672
You can't take those.

421
00:48:41,829 --> 00:48:45,145
Of course not. Proper channels
and paperwork. It's all here.

422
00:48:45,146 --> 00:48:46,671
Hold this for me.

423
00:48:48,499 --> 00:48:50,492
-Mmm. Yep. Here you go.
-Mmm.

424
00:49:07,710 --> 00:49:09,504
Coco is dead.

425
00:49:11,553 --> 00:49:13,446
Bones are gone.

426
00:49:14,074 --> 00:49:17,880
It's out. Already out.
How long'd that take?

427
00:49:18,581 --> 00:49:21,646
So, what do you have for me?
And don't say nothing.

428
00:49:22,447 --> 00:49:24,146
I found that.

429
00:49:24,859 --> 00:49:26,398
A sock?

430
00:49:28,343 --> 00:49:30,552
-Where'd you find it?
-Sapper's.

431
00:49:30,582 --> 00:49:32,424
Anything else?

432
00:49:32,425 --> 00:49:33,424
I burned everything else.

433
00:49:33,455 --> 00:49:36,568
Then what's this?
What's that date?

434
00:49:36,569 --> 00:49:37,568
Is that a birthday?
Is that a death day?

435
00:49:37,601 --> 00:49:39,337
I don't know yet.

436
00:49:42,802 --> 00:49:45,653
Am I the only one that can see
the fuckin' sunrise here?

437
00:49:45,700 --> 00:49:48,589
This breaks the world, "K."

438
00:50:00,983 --> 00:50:03,513
You know,
I've known a lot of your kind.

439
00:50:05,675 --> 00:50:10,415
All useful, but with you,
I sometimes forget.

440
00:50:11,143 --> 00:50:13,942
We didn't have any of you
where I was a kid.

441
00:50:19,549 --> 00:50:22,039
Do you remember anything?

442
00:50:22,616 --> 00:50:25,240
Before you were under me,

443
00:50:25,241 --> 00:50:26,240
you have any memories
from before?

444
00:50:26,304 --> 00:50:28,595
I have memories,

445
00:50:30,154 --> 00:50:32,678
but they're not real.
They're just implants.

446
00:50:33,867 --> 00:50:36,452
Tell me one.

447
00:50:36,453 --> 00:50:37,452
From when you were a kid.

448
00:50:42,174 --> 00:50:44,891
I feel a little strange
sharing a childhood story,

449
00:50:44,916 --> 00:50:47,031
considering
I was never a child.

450
00:50:49,021 --> 00:50:52,500
Well, would it help you share
if I told you it was an order?

451
00:50:55,152 --> 00:50:57,902
I have one
about a toy that I had.

452
00:50:57,965 --> 00:50:59,659
A wooden horse.

453
00:51:01,009 --> 00:51:03,074
With an inscription
underneath.

454
00:51:06,085 --> 00:51:08,968
All I remember
is a group of boys

455
00:51:08,969 --> 00:51:09,968
trying to take it away
from me.

456
00:51:10,446 --> 00:51:11,959
So I run.

457
00:51:37,021 --> 00:51:38,897
I go looking for a place
to hide it,

458
00:51:38,928 --> 00:51:41,397
and the only place
is this dark furnace.

459
00:51:43,012 --> 00:51:46,497
It's very dark
and I'm very scared,

460
00:51:46,695 --> 00:51:49,081
but this horse is all I have,

461
00:51:49,082 --> 00:51:50,081
so I go in anyway.

462
00:52:02,620 --> 00:52:04,391
Later on, those kids find me,

463
00:52:04,416 --> 00:52:08,020
and they beat me to tell 'em
where it is, but I don't.

464
00:52:14,235 --> 00:52:15,759
And that's it.

465
00:52:16,586 --> 00:52:17,922
Hmm.

466
00:52:18,308 --> 00:52:20,914
Little "K,"
fighting for what's his.

467
00:52:22,526 --> 00:52:24,236
It's a good one.

468
00:52:30,735 --> 00:52:32,239
Look at me.

469
00:52:34,609 --> 00:52:37,498
We're all just lookin' out
for somethin' real.

470
00:52:42,464 --> 00:52:44,801
What happens if I finish that?

471
00:52:48,554 --> 00:52:50,957
Shouldn't I get back
to work, madam?

472
00:53:00,259 --> 00:53:02,450
Check back in after DNAbase.

473
00:53:15,876 --> 00:53:18,650
Officer KD6-3.7.

474
00:53:21,497 --> 00:53:22,965
Request.

475
00:53:22,990 --> 00:53:26,685
DNA records:
children born 6-10-21.

476
00:53:27,024 --> 00:53:29,016
Looking for anomalies.

477
00:53:36,537 --> 00:53:38,308
You have
the satcrystal backup?

478
00:53:44,351 --> 00:53:45,934
Okay.

479
00:53:45,935 --> 00:53:46,934
Run it raw.

480
00:54:23,857 --> 00:54:25,949
Mere data makes a man.

481
00:54:27,829 --> 00:54:30,419
A and C and T and G.

482
00:54:30,853 --> 00:54:34,807
The alphabet of you.
All from four symbols.

483
00:54:36,350 --> 00:54:38,015
I'm only two:

484
00:54:41,410 --> 00:54:43,005
1 and 0.

485
00:54:43,295 --> 00:54:46,887
Half as much but twice
as elegant, sweetheart.

486
00:54:47,926 --> 00:54:50,018
You don't prefer your madam?

487
00:54:52,499 --> 00:54:54,130
You were listening.

488
00:54:55,056 --> 00:54:56,551
Maybe.

489
00:54:58,301 --> 00:55:01,197
You didn't like her enough
to tell her the truth.

490
00:55:01,879 --> 00:55:04,070
6, 10 and 21.

491
00:55:08,026 --> 00:55:10,018
There's nothin' to tell.

492
00:55:10,418 --> 00:55:13,526
How many times
have you told me that story?

493
00:55:15,629 --> 00:55:17,522
Your memory?

494
00:55:18,500 --> 00:55:20,775
The date carved beneath.

495
00:55:21,088 --> 00:55:23,326
6, 10 and 21.

496
00:55:25,229 --> 00:55:27,068
Coincidence?

497
00:55:31,041 --> 00:55:33,432
A dangerous coincidence.

498
00:55:36,931 --> 00:55:39,521
I always knew
you were special.

499
00:55:40,865 --> 00:55:42,896
Maybe this is how.

500
00:55:47,962 --> 00:55:49,633
A child.

501
00:55:50,152 --> 00:55:52,543
Of woman born.

502
00:55:53,652 --> 00:55:56,042
Pushed into the world.

503
00:55:57,119 --> 00:55:58,880
Wanted.

504
00:55:59,906 --> 00:56:01,501
Loved.

505
00:56:04,332 --> 00:56:06,523
Well, if it were true,

506
00:56:07,702 --> 00:56:10,382
I'd be hunted
for the rest of my life

507
00:56:10,383 --> 00:56:11,382
by someone just like me.

508
00:56:13,344 --> 00:56:15,635
It's okay to dream a little.

509
00:56:16,304 --> 00:56:17,827
Isn't it?

510
00:56:18,358 --> 00:56:20,140
Not if you're us.

511
00:56:25,339 --> 00:56:26,853
Stop.

512
00:56:27,482 --> 00:56:30,946
Put up 4847
and 2181, side-by-side.

513
00:56:36,833 --> 00:56:41,024
They're identical. Translate.

514
00:56:43,101 --> 00:56:44,994
A boy and a girl.

515
00:56:46,426 --> 00:56:48,033
It's impossible.

516
00:56:48,876 --> 00:56:50,322
Why?

517
00:56:50,919 --> 00:56:53,729
Two people
can't have identical DNA.

518
00:56:55,275 --> 00:56:59,118
One of these isn't real.
It's a copy.

519
00:57:03,883 --> 00:57:07,468
They were both processed
at the Morrill Cole Orphanage.

520
00:57:09,254 --> 00:57:11,445
It says the girl died there.

521
00:57:11,625 --> 00:57:13,518
Genetic disorder.

522
00:57:14,604 --> 00:57:16,497
Galatians Syndrome.

523
00:57:17,153 --> 00:57:18,917
And the boy...

524
00:57:20,882 --> 00:57:22,503
...disappears.

525
00:57:24,604 --> 00:57:26,497
Where's the orphanage?

526
00:57:28,821 --> 00:57:30,761
You wanna go for a ride?

527
00:58:46,740 --> 00:58:48,872
Well, here we are.

528
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:03,703
Buckle up.

529
01:00:02,748 --> 01:00:04,391
"K"?

530
01:00:56,024 --> 01:00:57,561
"K"? "K"?

531
01:00:59,366 --> 01:01:00,967
"K"? "K"? "K"? "K"? "K"?

532
01:01:54,343 --> 01:01:56,037
Stay back.

533
01:02:11,160 --> 01:02:12,629
Fire again.

534
01:02:13,011 --> 01:02:14,567
Fire again.

535
01:02:16,281 --> 01:02:17,783
Fire.

536
01:02:28,782 --> 01:02:31,073
200 feet to the east.

537
01:02:32,962 --> 01:02:34,441
Fire.

538
01:02:36,247 --> 01:02:37,816
Go north.

539
01:02:39,782 --> 01:02:41,334
Fire.

540
01:02:42,020 --> 01:02:45,007
Stop. 20 degrees east.

541
01:02:46,797 --> 01:02:48,192
Stop.

542
01:02:48,489 --> 01:02:50,067
Zoom in.

543
01:02:51,406 --> 01:02:52,942
Closer.

544
01:02:56,153 --> 01:02:58,276
Oh, come on.

545
01:02:59,247 --> 01:03:00,753
Get up.

546
01:03:01,153 --> 01:03:02,964
Do your fucking job.

547
01:03:04,154 --> 01:03:05,948
Find the child.

548
01:03:41,939 --> 01:03:43,533
Watch the car.

549
01:05:22,219 --> 01:05:23,680
Every last piece,

550
01:05:23,705 --> 01:05:26,513
or I'll put you outside
where the sky is raining,

551
01:05:26,538 --> 01:05:28,530
where it's raining fire!

552
01:05:28,737 --> 01:05:30,454
You're in here to work.

553
01:05:30,485 --> 01:05:33,876
And if you're not working,
I don't need you.

554
01:05:33,973 --> 01:05:35,965
I don't need any of...

555
01:05:38,544 --> 01:05:40,052
Hi.

556
01:05:46,529 --> 01:05:49,391
The nickel
is for the colonial ships.

557
01:05:49,440 --> 01:05:51,819
Closest any of them
or any of us is gonna get

558
01:05:51,844 --> 01:05:55,256
to that grand life
off-world.

559
01:05:56,329 --> 01:05:58,884
And I encourage play, I do.

560
01:05:58,885 --> 01:05:59,884
Keeps 'em occupied and it
makes 'em nimble, right?

561
01:05:59,983 --> 01:06:02,374
But it's work.

562
01:06:03,177 --> 01:06:04,970
It's work that molds them
into a child worth havin'.

563
01:06:05,466 --> 01:06:08,951
So come on, now.

564
01:06:17,609 --> 01:06:19,103
What sort do you have in mind?

565
01:06:20,562 --> 01:06:22,555
'Cause I got all kinds.

566
01:06:26,066 --> 01:06:29,146
-Oh, no, no, no.
-I'm not buyin'.

567
01:06:31,695 --> 01:06:33,641
No, no, no.
This is just my game,

568
01:06:33,674 --> 01:06:36,757
and I play it fair.

569
01:06:36,781 --> 01:06:38,523
No. No, I mean,
bigger than you...

570
01:06:38,709 --> 01:06:40,502
Bigger than you
have tried to shut me down.

571
01:06:42,614 --> 01:06:44,933
Bigger than you.

572
01:06:44,958 --> 01:06:47,121
And they were men, at that.

573
01:06:47,254 --> 01:06:49,316
A little boy came through here
about 30 years back.

574
01:06:51,350 --> 01:06:54,537
-I need to see your records.
-Hmm.

575
01:06:54,933 --> 01:06:57,025
Legitimate placements,
private sales, everything.

576
01:06:58,079 --> 01:07:00,967
Don't keep records
that far back.

577
01:07:01,041 --> 01:07:03,132
-You don't?
-I don't.

578
01:07:03,157 --> 01:07:05,050
Sorry.

579
01:07:07,115 --> 01:07:09,169
Can't help you.

580
01:07:09,170 --> 01:07:10,169
- You can't?
- Nope.

581
01:07:13,645 --> 01:07:15,538
I think you can.

582
01:07:20,115 --> 01:07:21,793
I think someone like you
keeps a long memory.

583
01:07:23,903 --> 01:07:26,849
Now you can tell me
what you remember,

584
01:07:26,874 --> 01:07:28,859
or I can put a hole right here
and take a look.

585
01:07:28,884 --> 01:07:31,960
They were laughin'
and what was it you said?

586
01:07:45,607 --> 01:07:48,454
What did you say?

587
01:08:07,257 --> 01:08:09,016
Are you comin'?

588
01:08:19,684 --> 01:08:21,276
Where is it?

589
01:08:24,349 --> 01:08:25,830
Oh, God.

590
01:08:31,020 --> 01:08:32,714
Where, where, where, where?

591
01:08:35,031 --> 01:08:37,287
I don't see it. Here.

592
01:08:46,148 --> 01:08:47,717
It's gone.

593
01:08:49,836 --> 01:08:52,426
It's the entire year.

594
01:08:53,974 --> 01:08:55,668
I didn't do that.

595
01:08:56,355 --> 01:08:57,884
That wasn't me.

596
01:09:01,388 --> 01:09:05,178
I didn't. Wasn't me.

597
01:13:38,540 --> 01:13:41,418
I always told you.

598
01:13:41,419 --> 01:13:42,419
You're special.

599
01:13:46,622 --> 01:13:48,725
Born.

600
01:13:48,726 --> 01:13:49,725
Not made.

601
01:13:53,752 --> 01:13:55,596
Hidden with care.

602
01:13:58,944 --> 01:14:01,036
A real boy now.

603
01:14:03,622 --> 01:14:06,012
A real boy needs a real name.

604
01:14:07,411 --> 01:14:08,988
Joe.

605
01:14:10,589 --> 01:14:12,089
"Joe"?

606
01:14:12,144 --> 01:14:14,472
You're too important for "K."

607
01:14:15,267 --> 01:14:17,541
Your mother
would've named you.

608
01:14:20,442 --> 01:14:21,870
Joe.

609
01:14:24,025 --> 01:14:26,217
-Joe.
-Stop.

610
01:14:32,763 --> 01:14:35,774
How do I know if a memory
is an implant or not?

611
01:14:39,500 --> 01:14:41,459
Who makes the memories?

612
01:15:12,996 --> 01:15:14,889
Dr. Ana Stelline?

613
01:15:18,669 --> 01:15:20,176
A visitor.

614
01:15:22,651 --> 01:15:24,129
Is that okay?

615
01:15:24,840 --> 01:15:26,357
Yes.

616
01:15:28,025 --> 01:15:29,918
It's just unusual.

617
01:15:31,509 --> 01:15:35,990
Nice to meet you,
Officer KD6-3.7.

618
01:15:40,168 --> 01:15:43,952
Sorry. It's a compromised
immune system.

619
01:15:44,448 --> 01:15:48,431
A life of freedom,
so long as it's behind glass.

620
01:15:48,792 --> 01:15:50,761
Is that why
you're not off-world?

621
01:15:50,796 --> 01:15:52,276
Yes.

622
01:15:52,349 --> 01:15:56,245
My parents had our passes
in pocket, but I took sick.

623
01:15:56,683 --> 01:16:01,454
So it was a new life for me.

624
01:16:01,767 --> 01:16:05,238
And they put me in my cage,

625
01:16:05,285 --> 01:16:08,542
filled it with everything
they could to keep me happy.

626
01:16:08,590 --> 01:16:13,128
Except company, of course.
And I was used to crowds.

627
01:16:16,398 --> 01:16:18,526
What can I help you with?

628
01:16:19,184 --> 01:16:22,194
Thought you might be able
to help me with a case.

629
01:16:23,122 --> 01:16:27,832
Oh, that's the most
interesting thing

630
01:16:27,833 --> 01:16:28,832
I've been offered
to help with in ages.

631
01:16:29,934 --> 01:16:33,320
Do you mind if I work
while you talk?

632
01:16:34,154 --> 01:16:35,661
Of course.

633
01:16:42,376 --> 01:16:44,866
I promise
I hear every word.

634
01:16:51,832 --> 01:16:54,817
They say you're the best
memory-maker there is.

635
01:16:54,918 --> 01:16:57,010
Well, then, they're kind.

636
01:16:58,202 --> 01:17:00,494
I love birthday parties.

637
01:17:04,158 --> 01:17:05,995
You work for Wallace.

638
01:17:06,364 --> 01:17:09,769
Subcontract.
I'm one of his suppliers.

639
01:17:10,216 --> 01:17:13,417
He offered to buy me out,

640
01:17:13,418 --> 01:17:14,417
but I take my freedom
where I can find it.

641
01:17:15,720 --> 01:17:17,414
Why are you so good?

642
01:17:18,009 --> 01:17:20,894
What makes your memories
so authentic?

643
01:17:20,966 --> 01:17:24,879
Well, there's a bit of
every artist in their work.

644
01:17:25,574 --> 01:17:29,457
But I was locked
in a sterile chamber at 8,

645
01:17:30,296 --> 01:17:32,740
so if I wanted to see
the world,

646
01:17:32,741 --> 01:17:33,740
I had to imagine it.

647
01:17:35,328 --> 01:17:38,170
Got very good at imagining.

648
01:17:39,807 --> 01:17:43,254
Wallace needs my talent
to maintain a stable product.

649
01:17:44,684 --> 01:17:46,875
I think it's only kind.

650
01:17:48,366 --> 01:17:50,655
Replicants live
such hard lives,

651
01:17:50,710 --> 01:17:53,779
made to do
what we'd rather not.

652
01:17:54,309 --> 01:17:55,942
I can't help your future,

653
01:17:55,975 --> 01:17:58,947
but I can give you
good memories

654
01:17:58,948 --> 01:17:59,947
to think back on and smile.

655
01:18:00,907 --> 01:18:02,731
It's nice.

656
01:18:02,732 --> 01:18:05,275
It's better than nice.
It feels authentic.

657
01:18:05,320 --> 01:18:08,228
And if you have
authentic memories,

658
01:18:08,614 --> 01:18:10,806
you have real human responses.

659
01:18:11,789 --> 01:18:13,474
Wouldn't you agree?

660
01:18:21,673 --> 01:18:23,661
Are they all constructed

661
01:18:24,063 --> 01:18:26,662
or do you ever use
ones that are real?

662
01:18:30,211 --> 01:18:33,320
It's illegal to use
real memories, officer.

663
01:18:35,331 --> 01:18:37,464
How can you tell
the difference?

664
01:18:37,506 --> 01:18:39,498
Can you tell if something

665
01:18:41,073 --> 01:18:42,695
really happened?

666
01:18:44,695 --> 01:18:46,986
They all think
it's about more detail.

667
01:18:47,643 --> 01:18:50,034
But that's not how
memory works.

668
01:18:50,874 --> 01:18:52,966
We recall with our feelings.

669
01:18:53,262 --> 01:18:56,449
Anything real
should be a mess.

670
01:18:58,146 --> 01:18:59,940
I can show you.

671
01:19:01,439 --> 01:19:02,934
Sit.

672
01:19:21,177 --> 01:19:25,747
Now, think about the memory
you want me to see.

673
01:19:26,507 --> 01:19:28,997
Not even that hard.
Just picture it.

674
01:19:30,090 --> 01:19:31,688
Let it play.

675
01:20:21,648 --> 01:20:23,939
Someone lived this, yes.

676
01:20:25,529 --> 01:20:27,114
This happened.

677
01:20:43,844 --> 01:20:45,578
I know it's real.

678
01:20:57,082 --> 01:20:58,785
I know it's real.

679
01:21:01,801 --> 01:21:05,104
God damn it!

680
01:21:49,212 --> 01:21:52,818
Officer KD6-3.7.

681
01:21:52,819 --> 01:21:53,818
Madam is calling you in.

682
01:21:53,849 --> 01:21:55,669
You're under arrest.
Drop your gun

683
01:21:55,694 --> 01:21:58,023
and keep your hands
where I can see 'em.

684
01:21:58,792 --> 01:21:59,886
- Cells.
- Cells.

685
01:21:59,887 --> 01:22:01,677
Have you ever
been in an institution?

686
01:22:01,678 --> 01:22:02,872
-Cells.
-Cells.

687
01:22:02,873 --> 01:22:04,858
When you're not
performing your duties,

688
01:22:04,859 --> 01:22:05,858
do they keep you
in a little box?

689
01:22:05,859 --> 01:22:06,953
-Cells.
-Cells.

690
01:22:06,954 --> 01:22:08,346
- Interlinked.
- Interlinked.

691
01:22:08,347 --> 01:22:10,332
What's it like
to hold the hand

692
01:22:10,333 --> 01:22:11,332
of someone you love?
Interlinked.

693
01:22:11,383 --> 01:22:14,123
Interlinked.

694
01:22:14,219 --> 01:22:15,383
Within cells interlinked.

695
01:22:15,384 --> 01:22:16,383
Within cells interlinked.

696
01:22:16,410 --> 01:22:17,603
- Dreadfully.
- Dreadfully.

697
01:22:17,604 --> 01:22:19,593
What's it like to
be filled with dread?

698
01:22:19,594 --> 01:22:20,688
-Dreadfully.
- Dreadfully.

699
01:22:20,689 --> 01:22:22,778
Do you like being
separated from other people?

700
01:22:22,779 --> 01:22:23,873
-Distinct.
-Distinct.

701
01:22:23,874 --> 01:22:25,963
-Dreadfully distinct.
-Dreadfully distinct.

702
01:22:25,964 --> 01:22:27,058
-Dark.
-Dark.

703
01:22:27,059 --> 01:22:28,547
Within cells interlinked.

704
01:22:28,548 --> 01:22:29,547
Within the cells
interlinked.

705
01:22:29,548 --> 01:22:32,333
- Within one stem.
- Within one stem.

706
01:22:32,334 --> 01:22:33,623
And dreadfully distinct.

707
01:22:33,624 --> 01:22:34,623
And dreadfully distinct.

708
01:22:34,624 --> 01:22:36,215
- Against the dark.
- Against the dark.

709
01:22:36,240 --> 01:22:38,432
A tall white
fountain played.

710
01:22:39,202 --> 01:22:41,394
A tall white
fountain played.

711
01:22:43,819 --> 01:22:45,967
You're not even
close to baseline.

712
01:22:52,042 --> 01:22:53,935
Out! Close the door.

713
01:22:54,829 --> 01:22:56,921
What the fuck is with you?

714
01:22:57,126 --> 01:22:59,252
I put you on a case.

715
01:22:59,284 --> 01:23:01,713
I impressed on you
the importance of that case,

716
01:23:01,745 --> 01:23:04,510
and then we pick you up

717
01:23:04,511 --> 01:23:05,510
fucking around
outside an upgrade center?

718
01:23:06,927 --> 01:23:09,495
Scan said you didn't look like
you on the inside.

719
01:23:09,520 --> 01:23:11,474
Miles off your baseline.

720
01:23:11,505 --> 01:23:13,156
Do you know what that means?

721
01:23:13,181 --> 01:23:14,675
I found the kid.

722
01:23:19,331 --> 01:23:22,127
He was set up
like a standard Replicant,

723
01:23:22,128 --> 01:23:23,127
put on a service job.

724
01:23:25,455 --> 01:23:27,637
Even he didn't know
who he was.

725
01:23:29,642 --> 01:23:31,333
-And?
-And it's done.

726
01:23:31,358 --> 01:23:33,538
What does that mean,
"it's done"?

727
01:23:33,539 --> 01:23:34,538
What you asked.

728
01:23:35,936 --> 01:23:37,484
It's done.

729
01:23:45,292 --> 01:23:47,654
You just stopped a bomb
from goin' off.

730
01:23:49,228 --> 01:23:50,818
You did good.

731
01:23:53,027 --> 01:23:55,152
I can help you
get outta this station alive,

732
01:23:55,177 --> 01:23:57,966
but you have 48 hours
to get back on track.

733
01:23:58,231 --> 01:24:00,221
Surrender your gun and badge.

734
01:24:00,276 --> 01:24:03,463
And your next baseline test
is outta my hands.

735
01:24:05,306 --> 01:24:06,894
Thank you, madam.

736
01:24:38,940 --> 01:24:40,564
You were right.

737
01:24:47,301 --> 01:24:49,571
You were right
about everything.

738
01:24:50,181 --> 01:24:51,665
Shh.

739
01:25:17,957 --> 01:25:21,343
Thought you weren't
interested, worky man.

740
01:25:24,427 --> 01:25:26,519
You liked her. I could tell.

741
01:25:29,451 --> 01:25:30,967
It's okay.

742
01:25:31,693 --> 01:25:33,233
She's real.

743
01:25:35,376 --> 01:25:37,468
I wanna be real for you.

744
01:25:38,760 --> 01:25:40,801
You are real for me.

745
01:25:41,861 --> 01:25:43,953
You have a special lady here.

746
01:26:02,165 --> 01:26:03,637
Okay.

747
01:26:03,958 --> 01:26:05,477
Let's do it.

748
01:26:27,233 --> 01:26:28,769
Look at you.

749
01:26:29,024 --> 01:26:31,066
Quiet now,
I have to sync.

750
01:29:27,098 --> 01:29:30,385
Joi is
anything you want her to be.

751
01:29:32,415 --> 01:29:35,547
Joi goes anywhere
you want her to go.

752
01:30:05,540 --> 01:30:09,087
99.9% detoxified water.

753
01:30:38,852 --> 01:30:40,344
It's from a tree.

754
01:30:40,345 --> 01:30:42,041
I'm done with you.

755
01:30:42,964 --> 01:30:44,478
You can go now.

756
01:30:56,171 --> 01:30:57,628
Quiet, now.

757
01:30:58,261 --> 01:30:59,955
I've been inside you.

758
01:31:00,605 --> 01:31:02,996
Not so much there
as you think.

759
01:31:22,049 --> 01:31:23,521
Coffee?

760
01:31:29,346 --> 01:31:31,560
They'll be comin'
after me soon.

761
01:31:40,309 --> 01:31:41,970
I'm coming with you.

762
01:31:42,799 --> 01:31:44,423
But not like this.

763
01:31:45,008 --> 01:31:47,178
If they come here
looking for you,

764
01:31:47,203 --> 01:31:49,578
they'll have access
to all my memories.

765
01:31:50,354 --> 01:31:52,929
You have to delete me
from the console.

766
01:31:53,938 --> 01:31:55,478
My present.

767
01:31:57,498 --> 01:31:59,040
Put me there.

768
01:32:01,212 --> 01:32:02,906
I can't do that.

769
01:32:04,395 --> 01:32:06,064
Think about it.

770
01:32:06,939 --> 01:32:09,591
If anything happens to this,
that's it.

771
01:32:10,622 --> 01:32:12,138
You're gone.

772
01:32:12,314 --> 01:32:13,825
Yes.

773
01:32:14,969 --> 01:32:16,513
Like a real girl.

774
01:32:22,565 --> 01:32:24,047
Please.

775
01:32:27,144 --> 01:32:28,937
Joe, please.

776
01:32:30,030 --> 01:32:31,707
I want this.

777
01:32:35,611 --> 01:32:37,418
But I can't do it myself.

778
01:32:55,365 --> 01:32:56,994
Break the antenna.

779
01:33:37,239 --> 01:33:39,022
I don't need a real horse.

780
01:33:41,917 --> 01:33:44,217
I don't need a real horse.
I just...

781
01:33:44,780 --> 01:33:46,289
I just wanna find out
where it's from.

782
01:33:46,290 --> 01:33:47,289
Okay.

783
01:33:56,923 --> 01:33:58,713
Radiation from a reactor?

784
01:34:06,393 --> 01:34:08,470
It matches a dirty bomb.

785
01:34:16,431 --> 01:34:19,001
There's only one place
that dirty.

786
01:34:20,512 --> 01:34:22,181
Nobody lives there.

787
01:35:13,065 --> 01:35:14,665
- Go to five.

788
01:35:15,355 --> 01:35:17,696
Four, 30 degrees to the left.

789
01:35:20,056 --> 01:35:21,579
Tilt up.

790
01:35:24,144 --> 01:35:26,055
Elevate to 400 feet.

791
01:35:31,977 --> 01:35:33,969
Radiation analysis.

792
01:35:36,854 --> 01:35:38,408
Move forward.

793
01:35:45,215 --> 01:35:46,713
Tilt up.

794
01:35:47,106 --> 01:35:48,585
Stop.

795
01:35:50,490 --> 01:35:52,058
Move forward.

796
01:35:52,779 --> 01:35:54,292
Go to five.

797
01:35:55,443 --> 01:35:57,402
Seven, move forward.

798
01:36:02,587 --> 01:36:04,031
Six.

799
01:36:05,359 --> 01:36:06,843
Stop.

800
01:36:09,432 --> 01:36:11,016
Go to seven.

801
01:36:11,629 --> 01:36:13,056
Eight.

802
01:36:14,018 --> 01:36:15,485
Nine.

803
01:36:19,155 --> 01:36:20,665
Heat analysis.

804
01:36:28,747 --> 01:36:30,205
Life.

805
01:36:30,801 --> 01:36:32,356
What is it?

806
01:36:32,990 --> 01:36:35,137
Guess we're about to find out.

807
01:36:45,233 --> 01:36:46,927
Too dark in here.

808
01:36:49,997 --> 01:36:51,511
I like him.

809
01:36:52,445 --> 01:36:54,019
He's a good boy.

810
01:36:55,248 --> 01:36:56,773
Where is he?

811
01:37:03,097 --> 01:37:04,599
I have no idea. He's off-duty.

812
01:37:05,737 --> 01:37:08,623
Check around.

813
01:37:08,724 --> 01:37:10,311
I checked

814
01:37:11,509 --> 01:37:13,573
anywhere a good boy
might go.

815
01:37:14,327 --> 01:37:15,922
You're too late.

816
01:37:18,952 --> 01:37:20,619
It's gone.

817
01:37:23,608 --> 01:37:25,401
He destroyed it.

818
01:37:27,635 --> 01:37:29,792
Everything about it.

819
01:37:30,246 --> 01:37:32,721
Well, except
for the box of bones

820
01:37:32,722 --> 01:37:33,721
that you already took.

821
01:37:37,701 --> 01:37:41,188
Which, I'll wager,
wasn't enough. Here you are.

822
01:37:49,033 --> 01:37:50,926
You tiny thing.

823
01:37:52,582 --> 01:37:55,944
In the face
of the fabulous new,

824
01:37:55,945 --> 01:37:56,944
your only thought
is to kill it?

825
01:37:57,608 --> 01:38:00,038
For fear of great change?

826
01:38:01,077 --> 01:38:04,067
You can't hold the tide
with a broom.

827
01:38:04,561 --> 01:38:06,454
Except that I did.

828
01:38:07,746 --> 01:38:09,440
Where is he?

829
01:38:13,120 --> 01:38:14,914
You're so sure.

830
01:38:16,190 --> 01:38:18,182
Because he told you.

831
01:38:18,595 --> 01:38:20,635
Because we never lie.

832
01:38:22,368 --> 01:38:25,547
I'm gonna tell Mr. Wallace
you tried to shoot me first.

833
01:38:26,404 --> 01:38:28,281
So I had to kill you.

834
01:38:32,928 --> 01:38:35,090
Then do what you gotta do.

835
01:38:36,113 --> 01:38:37,652
Madam.

836
01:39:09,480 --> 01:39:12,657
Location: Officer KD6-3.7.

837
01:44:00,690 --> 01:44:06,052
"Mightn't happen to have

838
01:44:06,562 --> 01:44:08,066
"a piece of cheese
about you, now?"

839
01:44:23,133 --> 01:44:24,703
Would you, boy?

840
01:44:30,066 --> 01:44:31,300
Treasure Island?

841
01:44:31,564 --> 01:44:33,144
He reads.

842
01:44:34,233 --> 01:44:35,762
That's good.

843
01:44:36,721 --> 01:44:38,239
Me, too.

844
01:44:39,246 --> 01:44:42,433
Not much else to do
around here at night anymore.

845
01:44:45,181 --> 01:44:49,619
"Many is the night
I dream of cheese,

846
01:44:53,243 --> 01:44:56,469
"toasted, mostly."

847
01:44:59,812 --> 01:45:01,537
What are you doing here?

848
01:45:04,689 --> 01:45:06,383
I heard the piano.

849
01:45:08,295 --> 01:45:09,890
Don't lie.

850
01:45:11,022 --> 01:45:12,524
It's rude.

851
01:45:14,573 --> 01:45:16,366
You're a cop.

852
01:45:17,530 --> 01:45:20,382
-I'm not here to take you in.
-Oh, yeah?

853
01:45:23,195 --> 01:45:24,716
Then, what?

854
01:45:26,809 --> 01:45:29,001
I just have some questions.

855
01:45:29,573 --> 01:45:31,266
What questions?

856
01:45:49,053 --> 01:45:50,550
Stay.

857
01:48:23,632 --> 01:48:26,746
Look,
I don't wanna hurt you.

858
01:48:26,978 --> 01:48:28,971
But you're not makin' it easy.

859
01:49:01,578 --> 01:49:06,758
â™ھ Like a river flows

860
01:49:06,759 --> 01:49:07,758
â™ھ Surely to the sea

861
01:49:08,711 --> 01:49:12,242
â™ھ Darling, so it goes

862
01:49:12,308 --> 01:49:17,368
â™ھ Some things are meant to be

863
01:49:18,100 --> 01:49:19,894
I like this song.

864
01:49:19,955 --> 01:49:23,762
â™ھ Take my hand

865
01:49:25,554 --> 01:49:30,372
â™ھ Take my whole life, too

866
01:49:30,429 --> 01:49:33,466
We could keep at this,
or we could get a drink.

867
01:49:33,490 --> 01:49:38,563
â™ھ For I can't help

868
01:49:38,985 --> 01:49:45,452
â™ھ Falling in love with you â™ھ

869
01:49:46,063 --> 01:49:47,644
I'll take the drink.

870
01:49:56,022 --> 01:49:57,915
This is really somethin'.

871
01:49:58,160 --> 01:49:59,953
The whole town
was somethin'.

872
01:50:00,402 --> 01:50:01,930
One time.

873
01:50:03,885 --> 01:50:05,878
Forget your troubles,

874
01:50:06,971 --> 01:50:08,864
see a show,

875
01:50:10,484 --> 01:50:12,377
gamble a little.

876
01:50:14,941 --> 01:50:17,431
Win some money,
lose some money.

877
01:50:18,333 --> 01:50:21,622
They made money
seem like candy.

878
01:50:22,000 --> 01:50:23,591
You like whiskey?

879
01:50:24,127 --> 01:50:27,309
I've got millions

880
01:50:27,310 --> 01:50:28,309
of bottles of whiskey.

881
01:50:42,704 --> 01:50:44,197
Here.

882
01:50:44,993 --> 01:50:46,557
Bleeding.

883
01:50:59,226 --> 01:51:00,672
Is it real?

884
01:51:01,316 --> 01:51:02,811
I don't know.

885
01:51:02,963 --> 01:51:04,477
Ask him.

886
01:51:21,123 --> 01:51:22,619
Ya got a name?

887
01:51:24,569 --> 01:51:27,367
Officer KD6-3.7.

888
01:51:27,814 --> 01:51:29,823
That's not a name.
That's a serial number.

889
01:51:31,873 --> 01:51:33,348
All right.

890
01:51:35,855 --> 01:51:37,363
Joe.

891
01:51:37,508 --> 01:51:39,457
What do you want, Joe?

892
01:51:40,631 --> 01:51:43,728
- I wanna ask you some questions.
- Like what?

893
01:51:50,187 --> 01:51:52,030
Like, what was her name?

894
01:51:52,277 --> 01:51:54,038
The mother of your child.

895
01:52:01,167 --> 01:52:03,060
What was she like?

896
01:52:13,697 --> 01:52:15,368
Did you live here together?

897
01:52:15,369 --> 01:52:16,986
Too many questions.

898
01:52:18,255 --> 01:52:20,548
I had your job.
I was good at it.

899
01:52:20,595 --> 01:52:23,082
- It was simpler then.
- Why are you making it complicated?

900
01:52:23,115 --> 01:52:25,674
- Why don't you just answer the question?
- What question?

901
01:52:25,699 --> 01:52:28,587
I didn't figure you,
as one for bullshit.

902
01:52:29,173 --> 01:52:30,967
What's her name?

903
01:52:44,134 --> 01:52:45,570
Rachael.

904
01:52:50,420 --> 01:52:52,413
Her name was Rachael.

905
01:52:56,406 --> 01:52:58,311
What happened to the kid?

906
01:53:01,253 --> 01:53:03,959
Who put it in the orphanage?
Was it you?

907
01:53:06,728 --> 01:53:08,919
I was long gone, by then.

908
01:53:12,401 --> 01:53:14,731
You didn't even meet your own kid?

909
01:53:17,311 --> 01:53:18,785
Why?

910
01:53:19,598 --> 01:53:21,889
Because that was the plan.

911
01:53:23,995 --> 01:53:26,525
I showed them how to
scramble the records,

912
01:53:26,550 --> 01:53:28,221
cover their tracks.

913
01:53:29,200 --> 01:53:31,889
Everyone had a part.
Mine was to leave.

914
01:53:33,345 --> 01:53:36,004
Then the Blackout came,
baked over everything.

915
01:53:36,029 --> 01:53:38,407
Couldn't have found the child,
if I tried.

916
01:53:38,649 --> 01:53:40,232
Did you want to?

917
01:53:40,355 --> 01:53:42,841
- Not really.
- Why not?

918
01:53:42,934 --> 01:53:45,878
Because we were being hunted!

919
01:53:46,043 --> 01:53:48,589
I didn't want our child found.

920
01:53:48,830 --> 01:53:51,855
Taken apart. Dissected!

921
01:53:55,897 --> 01:53:58,741
Sometimes, to love someone...

922
01:54:00,873 --> 01:54:02,768
you gotta be a stranger.

923
01:54:24,005 --> 01:54:25,537
To strangers!

924
01:54:42,865 --> 01:54:46,303
â™ھ It's quarter to three,

925
01:54:46,591 --> 01:54:49,742
â™ھ there's no one in the place

926
01:54:50,336 --> 01:54:52,552
â™ھ except you and me

927
01:54:56,838 --> 01:54:59,421
So, set 'em up, Joe,

928
01:55:00,957 --> 01:55:03,577
â™ھ I got a little story...

929
01:55:06,091 --> 01:55:08,412
â™ھ you oughtta know

930
01:55:11,413 --> 01:55:14,153
â™ھ We're drinkin', my friend,

931
01:55:15,522 --> 01:55:17,309
â™ھ to the end

932
01:55:19,153 --> 01:55:22,221
â™ھ of a brief episode

933
01:55:25,265 --> 01:55:28,466
â™ھ Make it one for my baby

934
01:55:31,573 --> 01:55:34,003
â™ھ and one more for the road.

935
01:56:37,332 --> 01:56:38,861
What'd you do?

936
01:56:39,131 --> 01:56:40,925
Who'd you bring?

937
01:56:42,615 --> 01:56:45,111
- No one.
- Oh, yeah?

938
01:56:50,629 --> 01:56:52,506
Target locked.

939
01:56:54,527 --> 01:56:56,420
They know you're here.

940
01:56:57,644 --> 01:56:59,438
I came alone.

941
01:59:06,209 --> 01:59:07,809
Bad dog!

942
01:59:24,775 --> 01:59:26,306
Stop!

943
01:59:42,371 --> 01:59:45,025
I do hope you're satisfied
with our product.

944
01:59:45,587 --> 01:59:47,111
I love you.

945
02:03:00,840 --> 02:03:02,331
Hey.

946
02:03:02,831 --> 02:03:05,588
There's someone who wants
to meet you.

947
02:03:06,835 --> 02:03:08,529
You can trust us.

948
02:03:16,567 --> 02:03:19,544
You must want me to look up
and to the left.

949
02:03:25,326 --> 02:03:27,020
This is Freysa.

950
02:03:27,515 --> 02:03:29,824
She fought with Sapper on Calantha.

951
02:03:29,849 --> 02:03:31,481
I recognize you.

952
02:03:33,762 --> 02:03:36,134
Did you help him hide the child?

953
02:03:36,290 --> 02:03:37,657
Oh...

954
02:03:37,967 --> 02:03:39,673
I was there.

955
02:03:43,294 --> 02:03:45,486
I saw a miracle delivered.

956
02:03:46,725 --> 02:03:50,012
A perfect little face crying up at me.

957
02:03:50,607 --> 02:03:52,500
Mad as thunder.

958
02:04:05,935 --> 02:04:07,562
Were you with her?...

959
02:04:09,419 --> 02:04:10,902
Rachael?

960
02:04:11,026 --> 02:04:13,019
I held her as she died.

961
02:04:14,618 --> 02:04:16,179
We hid the child,

962
02:04:16,234 --> 02:04:18,968
and made a vow to keep our secret.

963
02:04:19,511 --> 02:04:22,001
That's why Sapper let you kill him.

964
02:04:23,208 --> 02:04:24,776
I knew...

965
02:04:24,908 --> 02:04:29,165
that baby meant we are more
than just slaves.

966
02:04:30,420 --> 02:04:33,010
If a baby can come from one of us,

967
02:04:33,277 --> 02:04:36,295
we are our own masters.

968
02:04:36,622 --> 02:04:39,013
"More human than humans".

969
02:04:41,139 --> 02:04:43,032
A revolution is coming.

970
02:04:43,376 --> 02:04:45,567
And we're building an army.

971
02:04:46,750 --> 02:04:48,942
I want to free our people.

972
02:04:57,394 --> 02:05:00,979
If you want to be free, join us.

973
02:05:06,323 --> 02:05:09,260
Deckard, Sapper, you, me;

974
02:05:09,285 --> 02:05:12,919
our lives mean nothing
next to a storm that's coming.

975
02:05:14,009 --> 02:05:18,399
Dying for the right cause is the
most human thing we can do.

976
02:05:21,354 --> 02:05:23,545
You led to Wallace to Deckard.

977
02:05:24,268 --> 02:05:28,144
You cannot allow Deckard
to lead Wallace to me.

978
02:05:28,731 --> 02:05:30,902
You must kill Deckard.

979
02:05:40,099 --> 02:05:42,988
Deckard only wanted
his baby to be safe.

980
02:05:43,736 --> 02:05:45,530
And she is.

981
02:05:47,431 --> 02:05:48,923
When the time comes,

982
02:05:48,955 --> 02:05:51,008
I will show her to the world.

983
02:05:51,042 --> 02:05:53,131
And se will lead our army.

984
02:05:53,178 --> 02:05:54,664
She?

985
02:05:54,847 --> 02:05:56,541
Of course.

986
02:05:56,915 --> 02:05:59,007
Rachael had a daughter.

987
02:06:00,199 --> 02:06:03,336
With my own eyes, I saw her come.

988
02:06:04,081 --> 02:06:07,257
I dressed her blue when
it was time for her to go.

989
02:06:07,282 --> 02:06:09,573
It was a boy that you hid.

990
02:06:11,400 --> 02:06:14,210
That is just a piece of the puzzle.

991
02:06:31,252 --> 02:06:33,550
You imagined it was you?

992
02:06:35,339 --> 02:06:36,698
Oh.

993
02:06:37,071 --> 02:06:38,589
You did.

994
02:06:39,217 --> 02:06:40,729
You did.

995
02:06:43,386 --> 02:06:45,478
We all wish it was us.

996
02:06:47,147 --> 02:06:49,040
That's why we believe.

997
02:07:05,576 --> 02:07:07,469
Someone lived this, yes.

998
02:07:09,872 --> 02:07:14,452
I showed them how to scramble
the records, cover their tracks.

999
02:07:14,550 --> 02:07:17,438
With my own eyes,
I saw her come.

1000
02:07:18,730 --> 02:07:22,415
I dressed her in blue when
it was time for her to go.

1001
02:07:23,156 --> 02:07:26,260
There's a bit of every
artist in their work.

1002
02:08:03,919 --> 02:08:06,011
Always jumping, that one.

1003
02:08:07,203 --> 02:08:10,363
Never a thought, what to do,
if it made land.

1004
02:08:11,490 --> 02:08:16,071
All the courage in the world
cannot alter fact.

1005
02:08:20,807 --> 02:08:25,985
I have wanted to meet you
for so very long.

1006
02:08:44,429 --> 02:08:47,018
You are a wonder to me,
Mr Deckard.

1007
02:08:52,927 --> 02:08:54,592
I had the lock.

1008
02:08:56,327 --> 02:08:58,518
I found the key.

1009
02:08:59,803 --> 02:09:04,306
Yet the pins do not align,
the door remains locked.

1010
02:09:07,022 --> 02:09:10,408
I need a specimen to reach it, Mr Deckard.

1011
02:09:14,189 --> 02:09:15,664
The child.

1012
02:09:17,075 --> 02:09:18,968
I need the child.

1013
02:09:20,161 --> 02:09:22,634
To teach them all to fly.

1014
02:09:31,086 --> 02:09:34,969
"And God remembered Rachel,

1015
02:09:36,982 --> 02:09:38,636
"He heeded her

1016
02:09:39,570 --> 02:09:41,463
"and opened her womb."

1017
02:09:42,180 --> 02:09:44,032
Do you like our owl?

1018
02:09:46,629 --> 02:09:48,476
It's artificial?

1019
02:09:49,424 --> 02:09:51,160
Of course it is.

1020
02:09:52,808 --> 02:09:54,621
Must be expensive.

1021
02:09:56,287 --> 02:09:57,740
Very.

1022
02:09:57,791 --> 02:09:59,485
I'm Rachael.

1023
02:09:59,974 --> 02:10:01,469
Deckard.

1024
02:10:13,426 --> 02:10:15,020
Is it the same,...

1025
02:10:16,497 --> 02:10:18,741
now as then,...

1026
02:10:21,573 --> 02:10:23,764
the moment you met her?

1027
02:10:33,517 --> 02:10:36,809
All these years you
looked back on that day,

1028
02:10:36,834 --> 02:10:39,880
drunk on the memory
of its perfection.

1029
02:10:43,171 --> 02:10:45,462
How shiny, her lips!

1030
02:10:45,567 --> 02:10:48,267
How instant, your connection!

1031
02:10:51,257 --> 02:10:52,993
Did it never occur to you,

1032
02:10:53,018 --> 02:10:56,242
that's why you were summoned
in the first place?

1033
02:10:57,692 --> 02:11:00,614
Designed to do nothing short of,
fall for her,

1034
02:11:00,639 --> 02:11:03,239
right then and there.

1035
02:11:05,509 --> 02:11:07,962
All to make that single,

1036
02:11:08,002 --> 02:11:09,493
perfect...

1037
02:11:09,540 --> 02:11:11,081
specimen.

1038
02:11:14,103 --> 02:11:16,892
That is, if you were designed.

1039
02:11:18,453 --> 02:11:19,961
Love,

1040
02:11:20,216 --> 02:11:23,004
or mathematical precision.

1041
02:11:28,630 --> 02:11:30,106
Yes?

1042
02:11:30,896 --> 02:11:32,403
No?

1043
02:11:36,887 --> 02:11:38,979
I know what's real.

1044
02:12:02,990 --> 02:12:06,373
It was very clever to keep
yourself empty of information.

1045
02:12:06,398 --> 02:12:09,983
And all it cost you was, everything.

1046
02:12:14,144 --> 02:12:16,435
But you can still help me.

1047
02:12:17,727 --> 02:12:20,914
You help help in the hiding.

1048
02:12:23,386 --> 02:12:25,259
Where did they go?

1049
02:12:26,977 --> 02:12:29,069
I know, you know something.

1050
02:12:30,117 --> 02:12:31,565
Help me...

1051
02:12:32,492 --> 02:12:36,044
and very, very good things
can come to you.

1052
02:12:41,715 --> 02:12:43,509
You don't have children.

1053
02:12:47,212 --> 02:12:48,608
Do you?

1054
02:12:49,081 --> 02:12:51,471
Oh, I have millions.

1055
02:12:53,859 --> 02:12:57,045
You think I have nothing to offer
but pain?

1056
02:12:57,341 --> 02:12:59,035
Only, I know...

1057
02:13:00,428 --> 02:13:02,022
you love pain.

1058
02:13:03,413 --> 02:13:07,850
Pain reminds you,
the joy you felt was real.

1059
02:13:09,874 --> 02:13:11,582
More joy, then!

1060
02:13:17,945 --> 02:13:19,937
Do not be afraid.

1061
02:13:34,773 --> 02:13:36,367
An angel...

1062
02:13:37,593 --> 02:13:39,486
made again.

1063
02:13:43,204 --> 02:13:44,731
For you.

1064
02:14:18,879 --> 02:14:20,595
Did you miss me?

1065
02:14:38,664 --> 02:14:40,425
Don't you love me?

1066
02:14:59,369 --> 02:15:01,068
Her eyes were green.

1067
02:15:18,580 --> 02:15:20,350
Off-world,...

1068
02:15:20,982 --> 02:15:23,970
I have everything I need
to make you talk.

1069
02:15:26,144 --> 02:15:28,535
You do not know what pain is, yet.

1070
02:15:30,424 --> 02:15:32,101
You will learn.

1071
02:15:44,059 --> 02:15:45,952
Hello handsome.

1072
02:16:02,771 --> 02:16:05,361
What day, hm?

1073
02:16:09,048 --> 02:16:10,941
You look lonely.

1074
02:16:12,028 --> 02:16:13,921
I can fix that.

1075
02:16:17,412 --> 02:16:20,237
You look like a good Joe.

1076
02:16:55,445 --> 02:17:00,763
Dying for the right cause is the
most human thing we can do.

1077
02:17:03,786 --> 02:17:06,177
Because you've
nevert seen a miracle.

1078
02:17:44,593 --> 02:17:47,965
You are entering Los Angeles Airport,
restricted airspace

1079
02:17:48,004 --> 02:17:49,524
Confirm your identity.

1080
02:17:49,549 --> 02:17:53,134
Transport S-14 Branch D, confirmed.

1081
02:17:53,516 --> 02:17:56,094
Base, this is 06 outbound...

1082
02:17:58,330 --> 02:18:00,024
Where are we going?

1083
02:18:01,017 --> 02:18:02,512
Home.

1084
02:18:57,539 --> 02:19:01,470
Drive 2 down.
Backup engaged.

1085
02:19:02,022 --> 02:19:03,469
Warning.

1086
02:19:03,494 --> 02:19:06,084
- Can we make it?
- We're too low!

1087
02:19:06,628 --> 02:19:08,212
Take us back!

1088
02:19:57,217 --> 02:19:58,786
Get us up!

1089
02:20:23,080 --> 02:20:24,659
Open the door.

1090
02:22:17,223 --> 02:22:18,955
I am the best one.

1091
02:22:59,872 --> 02:23:01,751
Off-world is waiting.

1092
02:25:14,948 --> 02:25:17,407
Joe. Joe!

1093
02:25:27,584 --> 02:25:29,101
Joe!

1094
02:26:08,231 --> 02:26:10,491
You should've let me die out there.

1095
02:26:11,462 --> 02:26:13,030
You did.

1096
02:26:16,790 --> 02:26:18,618
You drowned out there.

1097
02:26:24,339 --> 02:26:27,156
You're free to meet your daughter, now.

1098
02:27:51,685 --> 02:27:54,176
All the best memories are hers.

1099
02:28:03,300 --> 02:28:04,820
Why?

1100
02:28:07,373 --> 02:28:09,132
Who am I to you?

1101
02:28:18,327 --> 02:28:20,109
Go meet your daughter.

1102
02:28:26,269 --> 02:28:27,963
You OK?

1103
02:31:03,943 --> 02:31:05,545
Just a moment.

1104
02:31:08,024 --> 02:31:10,041
Beautiful, isn't it?
