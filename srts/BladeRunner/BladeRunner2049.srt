1
00:05:00,375 --> 00:05:03,895
I hope you don't mind me
taking the liberty.

2
00:05:06,255 --> 00:05:08,512
I was careful
not to drag in any dirt.

3
00:05:08,661 --> 00:05:10,971
I don't mind the dirt.

4
00:05:11,688 --> 00:05:13,956
I do mind

5
00:05:15,419 --> 00:05:17,595
unannounced visits.

6
00:05:18,135 --> 00:05:20,775
You police?

7
00:05:23,304 --> 00:05:25,168
Are you Sapper Morton?
Civic number NK68514?

8
00:05:26,411 --> 00:05:31,150
I'm a farmer.

9
00:05:31,216 --> 00:05:33,146
I saw that.

10
00:05:33,390 --> 00:05:34,927
What do you farm?

11
00:05:35,455 --> 00:05:37,396
It's a protein farm.

12
00:05:44,421 --> 00:05:46,438
Wallace design.

13
00:05:46,911 --> 00:05:49,008
Is that what I smell?

14
00:05:50,556 --> 00:05:52,250
Grow that just for me.

15
00:05:52,802 --> 00:05:54,708
Garlic.

16
00:05:55,641 --> 00:05:57,331
Garlic.

17
00:05:57,332 --> 00:11:43,063
Go on, try some.

18
00:05:58,840 --> 00:06:00,733
No, thank you.

19
00:06:01,535 --> 00:06:03,229
I prefer to keep
an empty stomach

20
00:06:05,017 --> 00:06:09,395
until the hard part
of the day is done.

21
00:06:11,923 --> 00:06:13,652
How long you been here?

22
00:06:13,677 --> 00:06:15,314
Since 2020.

23
00:06:16,574 --> 00:06:19,414
But you haven't always
been a farmer, have you?

24
00:06:21,032 --> 00:06:22,646
Your bag.

25
00:06:22,842 --> 00:06:25,031
It's colonial medical use.

26
00:06:25,142 --> 00:06:26,858
Military issue.

27
00:06:29,229 --> 00:06:32,080
Where were you? Calantha?

28
00:06:36,460 --> 00:06:38,191
Must have been brutal.

29
00:06:38,652 --> 00:06:40,880
Plan on taking me in?

30
00:06:43,570 --> 00:06:45,511
Let them take a look inside?

31
00:06:45,762 --> 00:06:47,257
Mr. Morton,

32
00:06:48,210 --> 00:06:50,700
if taking you in
is an option,

33
00:06:54,857 --> 00:06:57,746
I would much prefer that
to the alternative.

34
00:06:58,963 --> 00:07:02,184
I'm sure you knew
it would be someone in time.

35
00:07:03,917 --> 00:07:05,999
I'm sorry it had to be me.

36
00:07:09,635 --> 00:07:11,546
Good as any.

37
00:07:16,289 --> 00:07:18,281
Now, if you don't mind,

38
00:07:18,870 --> 00:07:21,961
if you could just look up
and to the left, please.

39
00:08:18,607 --> 00:08:20,695
Please don't get up.

40
00:08:31,542 --> 00:08:34,810
How's it feel
killing your own kind?

41
00:08:38,469 --> 00:08:41,976
I don't retire my own kind
because we don't run.

42
00:08:43,980 --> 00:08:45,821
Only older models do.

43
00:08:45,846 --> 00:08:50,337
And you new models
are happy scraping the shit

44
00:08:54,825 --> 00:08:57,509
because you've never
seen a miracle.

45
00:09:38,615 --> 00:09:40,707
Just photograph everything.

46
00:09:52,344 --> 00:09:54,237
Madam, please.

47
00:09:54,448 --> 00:09:57,313
Incoming LAPD re-codec hash.

48
00:10:00,251 --> 00:10:03,239
You're hurt.
I'm not payin' for that.

49
00:10:04,034 --> 00:10:06,225
-I'll glue it.
-And?

50
00:10:12,242 --> 00:10:14,182
One of the tail-end Nexus 8s.

51
00:10:14,213 --> 00:10:17,081
He looks like he could
take your head off.

52
00:10:17,082 --> 00:10:18,081
He tried.

53
00:10:18,106 --> 00:10:20,245
He went AWOL after Calantha

54
00:10:20,304 --> 00:10:23,682
with a few more in his outfit
I wouldn't mind closin' out.

55
00:10:23,910 --> 00:10:26,201
-Just him?
-Just him.

56
00:10:26,767 --> 00:10:29,108
Come on home
for your baseline.

57
00:10:32,793 --> 00:10:34,599
One moment, madam.

58
00:11:22,194 --> 00:11:24,684
30 meters to maximum depth.

59
00:11:40,265 --> 00:11:41,844
What is that?

60
00:11:47,056 --> 00:11:49,041
I'll send a dig team.

61
00:11:49,913 --> 00:11:51,862
Come on home before the storm.

62
00:13:09,364 --> 00:13:13,045
Officer KD6-3.7.

63
00:13:13,070 --> 00:13:15,162
-Let's begin. Ready?
- Yes, sir.

64
00:13:16,331 --> 00:13:17,964
Recite your baseline.

65
00:13:17,989 --> 00:13:21,176
And blood-black
nothingness began to spin

66
00:13:22,869 --> 00:13:25,526
A system of cells
interlinked within cells

67
00:13:25,551 --> 00:13:27,847
interlinked within cells

68
00:13:27,848 --> 00:13:28,847
interlinked within one stem.

69
00:13:28,872 --> 00:13:30,677
Fuck off, skin-job.

70
00:13:32,350 --> 00:13:36,101
And dreadfully distinct
Against the dark,

71
00:13:36,102 --> 00:13:37,101
a tall white fountain played.

72
00:13:38,264 --> 00:13:39,557
- Cells.
- Cells.

73
00:13:39,582 --> 00:13:41,489
Have you ever been
in an institution?

74
00:13:41,514 --> 00:13:42,806
-Cells.
- Cells.

75
00:13:42,807 --> 00:13:44,100
Do they
keep you in a cell?

76
00:13:44,101 --> 00:13:45,394
-Cells.
- Cells.

77
00:13:45,395 --> 00:13:47,281
When you're not
performing your duties,

78
00:13:47,282 --> 00:13:48,281
do they keep you
in a little box?

79
00:13:48,282 --> 00:13:49,375
-Cells.
- Cells.

80
00:13:49,376 --> 00:13:51,267
- Interlinked.
- Interlinked.

81
00:13:51,268 --> 00:13:53,108
What's it like to hold
the hand of someone you love?

82
00:13:53,109 --> 00:13:54,601
-Interlinked.
- Interlinked.

83
00:13:54,602 --> 00:13:56,442
Did they teach you
how to feel finger to finger?

84
00:13:56,443 --> 00:13:57,836
-Interlinked.
- Interlinked.

85
00:13:57,837 --> 00:13:59,528
Do you long for having
your heart interlinked?

86
00:13:59,529 --> 00:14:00,921
-Interlinked.
- Interlinked.

87
00:14:00,922 --> 00:14:02,713
Do you dream
about being interlinked?

88
00:14:02,714 --> 00:14:03,509
Interlinked.

89
00:14:03,510 --> 00:14:05,300
What's it like to hold
your child in your arms?

90
00:14:05,301 --> 00:14:06,545
-Interlinked.
- Interlinked.

91
00:14:06,546 --> 00:14:08,286
Do you feel that there's
a part of you that's missing?

92
00:14:08,287 --> 00:14:09,481
-Interlinked.
- Interlinked.

93
00:14:09,482 --> 00:14:12,168
- Within cells interlinked.
- Within cells interlinked.

94
00:14:12,169 --> 00:14:13,601
Why don't you
say that three times.

95
00:14:13,602 --> 00:14:14,601
Within cells interlinked.

96
00:14:14,628 --> 00:14:17,703
Within cells interlinked.

97
00:14:17,728 --> 00:14:19,710
Within cells interlinked.
Within cells interlinked.

98
00:14:22,665 --> 00:14:24,260
We're done.

99
00:14:25,544 --> 00:14:27,238
Constant "K."

100
00:14:27,741 --> 00:14:29,782
You can pick up your bonus.

101
00:14:30,918 --> 00:14:32,525
Thank you, sir.

102
00:14:32,587 --> 00:14:34,562
Caution, keep clear.

103
00:14:35,677 --> 00:14:37,743
Caution, keep clear.

104
00:14:40,735 --> 00:14:43,417
Connect to off-world

105
00:14:43,418 --> 00:14:44,417
any time, any place.

106
00:14:44,418 --> 00:14:46,905
Packages start at 20 minutes.

107
00:14:46,906 --> 00:14:48,700
Many options available.

108
00:14:53,438 --> 00:14:56,724
Joi goes anywhere
you want her to go.

109
00:14:57,220 --> 00:15:01,255
Connect to
off-world any time, any place.

110
00:15:44,636 --> 00:15:48,154
"K"? I didn't hear you.
You're early.

111
00:15:48,219 --> 00:15:50,211
You want me to come back?

112
00:15:50,439 --> 00:15:52,737
Just go scrub.

113
00:15:54,629 --> 00:15:56,361
Yes, ma'am.

114
00:15:58,068 --> 00:15:59,862
How was your meeting?

115
00:16:00,216 --> 00:16:02,241
The usual.

116
00:16:03,350 --> 00:16:05,343
How was your day?

117
00:16:06,098 --> 00:16:09,291
I'm getting cabin fever.

118
00:16:12,889 --> 00:16:15,180
99.9% detoxified water.

119
00:16:15,731 --> 00:16:17,723
I had an accident at work.
I think I ruined my shirt.

120
00:16:18,156 --> 00:16:20,126
I'm sure
I can fix that for you.

121
00:16:20,151 --> 00:16:22,156
Let me take a look at it.

122
00:16:28,058 --> 00:16:29,752
I need a drink.

123
00:16:30,637 --> 00:16:33,325
Do you want a drink first?

124
00:16:33,326 --> 00:16:34,325
Mmm-hmm.
Pour me one, will ya?

125
00:16:36,034 --> 00:16:37,628
I'm trying a new recipe.

126
00:16:37,738 --> 00:16:39,740
I just need
a bit more practice.

127
00:16:39,765 --> 00:16:41,394
Don't fuss.

128
00:16:43,908 --> 00:16:46,173
I should have
marinated it longer.

129
00:16:46,295 --> 00:16:48,103
I hope it isn't dry.

130
00:16:50,216 --> 00:16:53,906
Did you know
this song was released

131
00:16:53,907 --> 00:16:54,906
in 1966 on Reprise Records?

132
00:16:55,523 --> 00:16:57,754
It was number one
on the charts.

133
00:17:02,842 --> 00:17:04,426
It won't be much longer.

134
00:17:04,451 --> 00:17:07,022
Just putting on
the finishing touches.

135
00:17:10,877 --> 00:17:14,755
Okay, it's ready.
I hope you're gonna like it.

136
00:17:14,780 --> 00:17:16,738
I told you not to fuss.

137
00:17:18,542 --> 00:17:20,361
And yet...

138
00:17:22,946 --> 00:17:25,675
Voilأ ! Bon appأ©tit.

139
00:17:28,334 --> 00:17:30,386
I missed you, baby sweet.

140
00:17:32,231 --> 00:17:34,223
Honey, it's beautiful.

141
00:17:34,452 --> 00:17:36,316
Just put your feet up.

142
00:17:36,989 --> 00:17:38,782
Relax.

143
00:17:56,813 --> 00:17:58,805
Was a day, hmm?

144
00:18:00,018 --> 00:18:01,799
It was a day.

145
00:18:02,614 --> 00:18:04,576
Would you read to me?

146
00:18:05,912 --> 00:18:07,466
It'll make you feel better.

147
00:18:07,535 --> 00:18:10,965
-You hate that book.
-I don't wanna read either.

148
00:18:12,693 --> 00:18:14,020
Let's dance.

149
00:18:14,045 --> 00:18:16,601
Do you wanna dance, or do you
wanna open your present?

150
00:18:16,641 --> 00:18:18,236
What present?

151
00:18:22,057 --> 00:18:23,565
This one.

152
00:18:23,663 --> 00:18:25,315
What's the occasion?

153
00:18:25,446 --> 00:18:27,338
Let's just say

154
00:18:27,671 --> 00:18:30,945
-it's our anniversary.
-Is it?

155
00:18:31,952 --> 00:18:36,530
No, but let's just
say that it is.

156
00:18:37,159 --> 00:18:38,554
Okay?

157
00:18:42,096 --> 00:18:43,823
Happy anniversary.

158
00:18:44,899 --> 00:18:46,692
An emanator.

159
00:19:29,173 --> 00:19:30,609
Thank you.

160
00:19:30,649 --> 00:19:34,732
Honey, you can go anywhere
you want in the world now.

161
00:19:35,841 --> 00:19:37,958
Where do you wanna go first?

162
00:21:51,812 --> 00:21:54,315
I'm so happy
when I'm with you.

163
00:21:56,443 --> 00:21:58,611
You don't have to say that.

164
00:22:29,758 --> 00:22:32,539
The dig's come through.
We have a new lead.

165
00:22:33,236 --> 00:22:34,876
Get down here.

166
00:22:48,373 --> 00:22:52,546
Carbon read: 14.6 GPH.

167
00:23:12,433 --> 00:23:15,876
Your box
is a military footlocker

168
00:23:15,877 --> 00:23:16,876
issued to Sapper Morton,

169
00:23:17,211 --> 00:23:20,068
creatively repurposed
as an ossuary:

170
00:23:20,139 --> 00:23:21,756
a box of bones.

171
00:23:22,167 --> 00:23:24,159
Nothin' else in it but hair.

172
00:23:25,305 --> 00:23:28,586
The soil samples indicate that

173
00:23:28,587 --> 00:23:29,586
she's been buried
for 30 years.

174
00:23:30,151 --> 00:23:33,429
Bones all dismantled,
fully cleaned,

175
00:23:33,430 --> 00:23:34,429
meticulously laid to rest.

176
00:23:34,491 --> 00:23:36,086
"She"?

177
00:23:37,351 --> 00:23:39,268
Cause of death, Coco?

178
00:23:49,819 --> 00:23:53,443
No breaks,
no sign of trauma, except

179
00:23:54,227 --> 00:23:56,718
a fracture
through the ilium.

180
00:23:57,439 --> 00:24:00,384
It's a narrow birth canal.
Baby must have got stuck.

181
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:03,353
- She was pregnant?
- Hmm.

182
00:24:03,618 --> 00:24:06,310
So he didn't kill her?

183
00:24:06,311 --> 00:24:07,310
Mmm. She died in childbirth.

184
00:24:09,122 --> 00:24:10,648
What's that?

185
00:24:11,702 --> 00:24:13,242
Go back.

186
00:24:14,007 --> 00:24:15,531
Closer.

187
00:24:16,864 --> 00:24:18,458
Closer.

188
00:24:21,168 --> 00:24:22,822
What's that?

189
00:24:24,404 --> 00:24:25,797
Huh.

190
00:24:25,891 --> 00:24:29,308
Notching in the iliac crest.

191
00:24:29,837 --> 00:24:33,140
It's fine-point,
like a scalpel.

192
00:24:34,146 --> 00:24:36,797
That looks like
an emergency C-section.

193
00:24:37,263 --> 00:24:40,748
The cuts are clean.
No sign of a struggle.

194
00:24:41,518 --> 00:24:43,341
He was a combat medic.

195
00:24:44,073 --> 00:24:46,370
Maybe he tried to save her
and he just couldn't.

196
00:24:46,409 --> 00:24:48,458
He didn't seem like
the saving type.

197
00:24:48,483 --> 00:24:50,917
He went to the trouble
of burying her.

198
00:24:51,125 --> 00:24:53,266
A sentimental skin-job.

199
00:24:55,222 --> 00:24:56,656
Sorry.

200
00:24:57,067 --> 00:24:58,939
So where's the kid?

201
00:25:00,328 --> 00:25:02,210
You scan the whole field?

202
00:25:02,249 --> 00:25:03,866
Just dirt and worms.

203
00:25:03,867 --> 00:25:04,866
No other bodies.

204
00:25:04,891 --> 00:25:06,522
Maybe he ate it.

205
00:25:55,388 --> 00:25:57,337
That's not possible.

206
00:25:59,806 --> 00:26:01,699
She was a Replicant.

207
00:26:04,262 --> 00:26:05,924
Pregnant.

208
00:26:14,885 --> 00:26:18,961
The world is built on a wall.

209
00:26:18,962 --> 00:26:19,961
It separates kind.

210
00:26:21,088 --> 00:26:23,673
Tell either side
there's no wall,

211
00:26:23,674 --> 00:26:24,673
you bought a war.

212
00:26:25,303 --> 00:26:26,970
Or a slaughter.

213
00:26:30,696 --> 00:26:32,689
So, what you saw

214
00:26:34,685 --> 00:26:36,537
didn't happen.

215
00:26:38,268 --> 00:26:39,736
Yes, madam.

216
00:26:39,761 --> 00:26:42,646
It is my job to keep order.

217
00:26:42,762 --> 00:26:45,651
That's what we do here.
We keep order.

218
00:26:47,525 --> 00:26:49,219
You want it gone?

219
00:26:50,686 --> 00:26:52,377
Erase everything.

220
00:26:52,426 --> 00:26:54,244
Even the child?

221
00:26:54,245 --> 00:26:55,244
All trace.

222
00:26:59,478 --> 00:27:01,647
You have anything more to say?

223
00:27:03,313 --> 00:27:06,373
I've never retired something
that was born before.

224
00:27:07,364 --> 00:27:09,252
What's the difference?

225
00:27:13,167 --> 00:27:15,657
To be born is to have a soul,
I guess.

226
00:27:16,734 --> 00:27:18,627
Are you telling me no?

227
00:27:19,607 --> 00:27:22,158
I wasn't aware
that was an option, madam.

228
00:27:22,194 --> 00:27:23,830
Attaboy.

229
00:27:26,896 --> 00:27:28,292
Hey.

230
00:27:28,473 --> 00:27:30,664
You've been getting on fine
without one.

231
00:27:31,055 --> 00:27:32,610
What's that, madam?

232
00:27:32,860 --> 00:27:34,452
A soul.

233
00:28:21,184 --> 00:28:26,162
And you new models
are happy scraping the shit

234
00:28:28,273 --> 00:28:30,819
because you've never seen
a miracle.

235
00:28:54,822 --> 00:28:57,389
Just checking in
on an old serial number.

236
00:29:02,279 --> 00:29:04,172
Confirmation DNA?

237
00:29:05,094 --> 00:29:06,868
I got hair.

238
00:29:23,891 --> 00:29:27,332
Oh! An old one.

239
00:29:27,995 --> 00:29:29,864
Pre-Blackout. Huh.

240
00:29:31,044 --> 00:29:33,236
That's gonna be tough.

241
00:29:34,197 --> 00:29:36,683
Not much from then.

242
00:29:36,684 --> 00:29:37,683
And what's there is

243
00:29:38,338 --> 00:29:40,132
thick milky.

244
00:29:41,012 --> 00:29:43,897
You can customize them
as much as you'd like.

245
00:29:44,273 --> 00:29:46,663
As human
as you want them to be.

246
00:29:47,154 --> 00:29:50,451
But your operation is strictly
a drill site, isn't it?

247
00:29:50,766 --> 00:29:54,148
I wouldn't waste your money
on intelligence,

248
00:29:54,149 --> 00:29:55,148
attachment or appeal.

249
00:29:55,857 --> 00:29:59,574
Unless you'd like to add some
pleasure models to your order.

250
00:30:12,896 --> 00:30:16,073
Would it be possible to
reschedule this call, please?

251
00:30:18,535 --> 00:30:20,988
Everyone remembers

252
00:30:20,989 --> 00:30:21,988
where they were
at the Blackout. You?

253
00:30:22,020 --> 00:30:24,372
That was a little
before my time.

254
00:30:24,428 --> 00:30:26,910
Mmm. I was home with my folks,

255
00:30:27,044 --> 00:30:29,714
then ten days of darkness.
Every machine stopped cold.

256
00:30:29,739 --> 00:30:32,256
When the lights came back,
we were wiped clean.

257
00:30:32,281 --> 00:30:36,117
Photos, files, every bit of
data... Ffft! Gone.

258
00:30:36,150 --> 00:30:38,135
Bank records, too.

259
00:30:38,136 --> 00:30:39,135
Didn't mind that.

260
00:30:39,238 --> 00:30:41,327
It's funny it's only paper
that lasted.

261
00:30:41,351 --> 00:30:44,218
I mean, we had
everything on drives.

262
00:30:44,219 --> 00:30:45,217
Everything, everything,
everything! Huh.

263
00:30:46,603 --> 00:30:49,691
My mom still cries
over the lost baby pictures.

264
00:30:49,827 --> 00:30:52,126
Well, it's a shame. You

265
00:30:52,127 --> 00:30:53,126
-must have been adorable.
-Hmm... Ah.

266
00:30:53,213 --> 00:30:55,244
Uh...

267
00:30:59,374 --> 00:31:02,163
Pretty fractured.
Not much on it.

268
00:31:03,126 --> 00:31:05,666
One of the last gens,
pre-Prohibition.

269
00:31:05,913 --> 00:31:09,166
Standard issue.
Made by Tyrell.

270
00:31:09,810 --> 00:31:11,345
And?

271
00:31:11,586 --> 00:31:13,674
Unremarkable.

272
00:31:13,675 --> 00:31:14,674
"Unremarkable"?

273
00:31:14,847 --> 00:31:17,787
There must be something
else we can find for him.

274
00:31:25,152 --> 00:31:27,742
Another prodigal
serial number returns.

275
00:31:29,273 --> 00:31:32,161
A 30-year-old open case
finally closed.

276
00:31:32,710 --> 00:31:34,549
Thank you, officer.

277
00:31:35,474 --> 00:31:37,889
I'm here for Mr. Wallace.
I'm Luv.

278
00:31:40,045 --> 00:31:41,780
He named you.

279
00:31:42,420 --> 00:31:44,256
Must be special.

280
00:31:44,846 --> 00:31:46,772
I'm here for Mr. Wallace.

281
00:31:46,773 --> 00:31:47,772
Follow me.

282
00:31:54,186 --> 00:31:57,672
The ancient models
give the entire endeavor
a bad name.

283
00:31:58,964 --> 00:32:03,644
What a gift, don't you think,
from Mr. Wallace to the world?

284
00:32:06,753 --> 00:32:09,508
The outer colonies
would never have flourished

285
00:32:09,509 --> 00:32:10,508
had he not bought Tyrell,

286
00:32:10,556 --> 00:32:12,648
revivified the technology.

287
00:32:13,495 --> 00:32:15,587
To say the least
of what we do.

288
00:32:18,917 --> 00:32:20,964
I see you're also a customer.

289
00:32:21,283 --> 00:32:23,800
Are you satisfied
with our product?

290
00:32:23,990 --> 00:32:27,674
She's very realistic.
Thank you.

291
00:32:28,500 --> 00:32:30,958
Here. All the junk is in here.

292
00:32:31,279 --> 00:32:34,168
Lucky for you,
Mr. Wallace is a data hoarder.

293
00:32:46,677 --> 00:32:48,916
No one's been
down here in ages.

294
00:32:51,855 --> 00:32:53,681
Sorry about that.

295
00:33:05,022 --> 00:33:08,655
All our memory bearings
from the time.

296
00:33:08,656 --> 00:33:09,655
They were all damaged
in the Blackout.

297
00:33:10,004 --> 00:33:12,499
But there are
sometimes fragments.

298
00:33:28,292 --> 00:33:29,826
You got a little boy.

299
00:33:29,818 --> 00:33:31,543
He shows you
his butterfly collection,

300
00:33:31,544 --> 00:33:32,543
plus the killing jar.

301
00:33:32,575 --> 00:33:34,511
I'd take him
to the doctor.

302
00:33:36,918 --> 00:33:39,290
There's a wasp
crawling on your arm.

303
00:33:39,291 --> 00:33:40,290
I'd kill it.

304
00:33:42,326 --> 00:33:45,428
You're reading a magazine.

305
00:33:45,429 --> 00:33:46,428
You come across a full-page
nude photo of a girl.

306
00:33:46,459 --> 00:33:48,621
Is this testing
whether I'm a Replicant

307
00:33:48,622 --> 00:33:49,621
or a lesbian, Mr. Deckard?

308
00:33:49,646 --> 00:33:51,965
Just answer
the questions, please.

309
00:33:55,470 --> 00:33:59,152
It was unclear what she was,
at least to someone.

310
00:33:59,300 --> 00:34:00,909
This was a test.

311
00:34:01,497 --> 00:34:03,689
We were difficult
to spot then.

312
00:34:05,394 --> 00:34:08,633
Was there anything unusual
about how you found her?

313
00:34:08,783 --> 00:34:11,400
To warrant an official
investigation?

314
00:34:13,832 --> 00:34:16,972
You know how people are
about old serial numbers.

315
00:34:17,483 --> 00:34:20,096
Everyone just sleeps better

316
00:34:20,097 --> 00:34:21,096
when they know
where they got to.

317
00:34:23,852 --> 00:34:25,427
She likes him.

318
00:34:26,661 --> 00:34:28,169
Who?

319
00:34:28,330 --> 00:34:30,721
This Officer Deckard.

320
00:34:31,914 --> 00:34:33,919
She's trying to provoke him.

321
00:34:37,311 --> 00:34:40,697
It is invigorating being asked
personal questions.

322
00:34:40,994 --> 00:34:42,688
Makes one feel

323
00:34:43,919 --> 00:34:45,859
desired.

324
00:34:46,682 --> 00:34:48,889
Do you enjoy
your work, officer?

325
00:34:53,291 --> 00:34:55,714
Please thank Mr. Wallace
for your time.

326
00:35:07,984 --> 00:35:10,669
You worked
with Officer Deckard

327
00:35:10,670 --> 00:35:11,669
back in the day.

328
00:35:12,423 --> 00:35:14,491
What can you tell me
about him?

329
00:35:14,987 --> 00:35:17,179
He liked to work alone.

330
00:35:18,165 --> 00:35:20,010
So did I.

331
00:35:21,971 --> 00:35:25,158
So we worked together
to keep it that way.

332
00:35:26,406 --> 00:35:28,009
That was it.

333
00:35:28,994 --> 00:35:31,313
Anything else
you can tell me?

334
00:35:32,930 --> 00:35:35,281
He wasn't long for this world.

335
00:35:37,531 --> 00:35:39,145
How so?

336
00:35:41,274 --> 00:35:43,665
Something in his eyes.

337
00:35:46,763 --> 00:35:49,253
Any idea how I could
contact him?

338
00:35:49,549 --> 00:35:51,073
None.

339
00:35:52,436 --> 00:35:54,727
He's nyugdأ­jas.

340
00:35:57,820 --> 00:35:59,343
Retired.

341
00:36:00,695 --> 00:36:02,227
What happened?

342
00:36:02,252 --> 00:36:04,742
Probably got what he wanted.

343
00:36:06,976 --> 00:36:08,769
To be alone.

344
00:36:33,612 --> 00:36:35,605
Welcome back, sir.

345
00:36:36,942 --> 00:36:39,733
You wanted to review
the new model, sir,

346
00:36:39,734 --> 00:36:40,733
before shipment?

347
00:36:41,657 --> 00:36:45,065
An angel
should never enter

348
00:36:45,066 --> 00:36:46,065
the kingdom of heaven

349
00:36:46,550 --> 00:36:48,417
without a gift.

350
00:36:50,662 --> 00:36:54,148
Can you at least pronounce,
"A child is born"?

351
00:36:56,682 --> 00:36:58,307
Hmm.

352
00:37:05,066 --> 00:37:06,869
A new model.

353
00:37:14,361 --> 00:37:16,751
Well, let us see her, then.

354
00:38:05,164 --> 00:38:07,813
The first thought

355
00:38:10,398 --> 00:38:12,391
one tends to fear,

356
00:38:13,632 --> 00:38:15,624
to preserve the clay.

357
00:38:18,225 --> 00:38:20,118
It's fascinating.

358
00:38:21,144 --> 00:38:23,887
Before we even know
what we are,

359
00:38:26,162 --> 00:38:27,887
we fear to lose it.

360
00:38:29,550 --> 00:38:31,291
Happy birthday.

361
00:38:40,729 --> 00:38:42,215
Now, let's have a look at you.

362
00:39:34,215 --> 00:39:36,719
We make angels

363
00:39:37,719 --> 00:39:41,923
in the service
of civilization.

364
00:39:41,923 --> 00:39:45,193
Yes, there were
bad angels once.

365
00:39:45,193 --> 00:39:47,596
I make good angels now.

366
00:39:33,543 --> 00:39:37,740
That is how I took us
to nine new worlds.

367
00:39:40,806 --> 00:39:42,301
Nine.

368
00:39:43,860 --> 00:39:47,415
A child can count to nine
on fingers.

369
00:39:47,444 --> 00:39:50,282
We should own the stars.

370
00:39:50,314 --> 00:39:51,891
Yes, sir.

371
00:39:54,733 --> 00:39:57,181
Every leap
of civilization

372
00:39:57,206 --> 00:39:59,862
was built off the back
of a disposable workforce.

373
00:39:59,893 --> 00:40:02,899
We lost our stomach
for slaves

374
00:40:03,135 --> 00:40:05,210
unless engineered.

375
00:40:08,368 --> 00:40:10,659
But I can only make so many.

376
00:40:16,363 --> 00:40:18,754
That barren pasture,

377
00:40:19,479 --> 00:40:21,729
empty

378
00:40:21,730 --> 00:40:22,729
and salted...

379
00:40:24,686 --> 00:40:26,180
...right here.

380
00:40:28,277 --> 00:40:31,663
The dead space
between the stars.

381
00:40:33,693 --> 00:40:36,880
And this, the seat that
we must change for heaven.

382
00:40:41,874 --> 00:40:46,460
I cannot breed them.
So help me, I have tried.

383
00:40:47,262 --> 00:40:50,346
We need more Replicants
than can ever be assembled.

384
00:40:50,411 --> 00:40:54,017
Millions, so we can be
trillions more.

385
00:40:55,847 --> 00:40:58,810
We could storm Eden
and retake her.

386
00:41:11,174 --> 00:41:13,665
Tyrell's final trick:

387
00:41:14,160 --> 00:41:16,153
Procreation.

388
00:41:16,250 --> 00:41:19,636
Perfected, then lost.

389
00:41:20,729 --> 00:41:23,120
But there is a child.

390
00:41:25,706 --> 00:41:27,599
Bring it to me.

391
00:41:27,896 --> 00:41:29,589
Sir.

392
00:41:37,592 --> 00:41:39,784
The best angel of all.

393
00:41:41,159 --> 00:41:42,753
Aren't you, Luv?

394
00:43:00,683 --> 00:43:03,176
The man with the green jacket.

395
00:43:03,177 --> 50:43:06,215
The one who killed Sapper.
Find out what he knows.

396
00:43:25,444 --> 00:43:26,940
Hi.

397
00:43:27,902 --> 00:43:30,193
Hello, hello, A-Boy.

398
00:43:30,414 --> 00:43:32,208
You alone?

399
00:43:38,108 --> 00:43:41,209
It's okay.
It's fine.

400
00:43:46,744 --> 00:43:48,779
Wanna buy a lady a cigarette?

401
00:43:55,404 --> 00:43:57,637
Oh, you don't even smile.

402
00:43:59,882 --> 00:44:01,871
Didn't you hear your friends?

403
00:44:02,234 --> 00:44:04,240
Don't you know what I am?

404
00:44:04,349 --> 00:44:05,803
Yeah.

405
00:44:06,131 --> 00:44:08,124
Guy eating rice.

406
00:44:09,338 --> 00:44:10,845
What's that?

407
00:44:11,957 --> 00:44:13,517
It's a tree.

408
00:44:13,847 --> 00:44:16,636
Oh. Never seen a tree before.

409
00:44:18,496 --> 00:44:20,138
It's pretty.

410
00:44:22,018 --> 00:44:23,722
It's dead.

411
00:44:25,164 --> 00:44:29,645
Now, who keeps a dead tree?

412
00:44:32,946 --> 00:44:34,453
Hmm?

413
00:44:36,785 --> 00:44:38,675
You're not gonna kill me,
are you?

414
00:44:38,716 --> 00:44:42,102
Depends.
What's your model number?

415
00:44:42,301 --> 00:44:45,179
Why don't you look under
my eye and find out.

416
00:44:47,452 --> 00:44:48,828
Oh!

417
00:44:49,551 --> 00:44:51,633
You don't like real girls.

418
00:44:54,789 --> 00:44:57,678
Well, I'm always here.

419
00:48:36,577 --> 00:48:38,284
Hi.

420
00:48:39,717 --> 00:48:41,372
You can't take those.

421
00:48:41,529 --> 00:48:44,845
Of course not. Proper channels
and paperwork. It's all here.

422
00:48:44,846 --> 00:48:46,371
Hold this for me.

423
00:48:48,199 --> 00:48:50,192
-Mmm. Yep. Here you go.
-Mmm.

424
00:49:07,410 --> 00:49:09,204
Coco is dead.

425
00:49:11,253 --> 00:49:13,146
Bones are gone.

426
00:49:13,774 --> 00:49:17,580
It's out. Already out.
How long'd that take?

427
00:49:18,281 --> 00:49:21,346
So, what do you have for me?
And don't say nothing.

428
00:49:22,147 --> 00:49:23,846
I found that.

429
00:49:24,559 --> 00:49:26,098
A sock?

430
00:49:28,043 --> 00:49:30,252
-Where'd you find it?
-Sapper's.

431
00:49:30,282 --> 00:49:32,124
Anything else?

432
00:49:32,125 --> 00:49:33,124
I burned everything else.

433
00:49:33,155 --> 00:49:36,268
Then what's this?
What's that date?

434
00:49:36,269 --> 00:49:37,268
Is that a birthday?
Is that a death day?

435
00:49:37,301 --> 00:49:39,037
I don't know yet.

436
00:49:42,502 --> 00:49:45,353
Am I the only one that can see
the fuckin' sunrise here?

437
00:49:45,400 --> 00:49:48,289
This breaks the world, "K."

438
00:50:00,683 --> 00:50:03,213
You know,
I've known a lot of your kind.

439
00:50:05,375 --> 00:50:10,115
All useful, but with you,
I sometimes forget.

440
00:50:10,843 --> 00:50:13,642
We didn't have any of you
where I was a kid.

441
00:50:19,249 --> 00:50:21,739
Do you remember anything?

442
00:50:22,316 --> 00:50:24,940
Before you were under me,

443
00:50:24,941 --> 00:50:25,940
you have any memories
from before?

444
00:50:26,004 --> 00:50:28,295
I have memories,

445
00:50:29,854 --> 00:50:32,378
but they're not real.
They're just implants.

446
00:50:33,567 --> 00:50:36,152
Tell me one.

447
00:50:36,153 --> 00:50:37,152
From when you were a kid.

448
00:50:41,874 --> 00:50:44,591
I feel a little strange
sharing a childhood story,

449
00:50:44,616 --> 00:50:46,731
considering
I was never a child.

450
00:50:48,721 --> 00:50:52,200
Well, would it help you share
if I told you it was an order?

451
00:50:54,852 --> 00:50:57,602
I have one
about a toy that I had.

452
00:50:57,665 --> 00:50:59,359
A wooden horse.

453
00:51:00,709 --> 00:51:02,774
With an inscription
underneath.

454
00:51:05,785 --> 00:51:08,668
All I remember
is a group of boys

455
00:51:08,669 --> 00:51:09,668
trying to take it away
from me.

456
00:51:10,146 --> 00:51:11,659
So I run.

457
00:51:36,721 --> 00:51:38,597
I go looking for a place
to hide it,

458
00:51:38,628 --> 00:51:41,097
and the only place
is this dark furnace.

459
00:51:42,712 --> 00:51:46,197
It's very dark
and I'm very scared,

460
00:51:46,395 --> 00:51:48,781
but this horse is all I have,

461
00:51:48,782 --> 00:51:49,781
so I go in anyway.

462
00:52:02,320 --> 00:52:04,091
Later on, those kids find me,

463
00:52:04,116 --> 00:52:07,720
and they beat me to tell 'em
where it is, but I don't.

464
00:52:13,935 --> 00:52:15,459
And that's it.

465
00:52:16,286 --> 00:52:17,622
Hmm.

466
00:52:18,008 --> 00:52:20,614
Little "K,"
fighting for what's his.

467
00:52:22,226 --> 00:52:23,936
It's a good one.

468
00:52:30,435 --> 00:52:31,939
Look at me.

469
00:52:34,309 --> 00:52:37,198
We're all just lookin' out
for somethin' real.

470
00:52:42,164 --> 00:52:44,501
What happens if I finish that?

471
00:52:48,254 --> 00:52:50,657
Shouldn't I get back
to work, madam?

472
00:52:59,959 --> 00:53:02,150
Check back in after DNAbase.

473
00:53:15,576 --> 00:53:18,350
Officer KD6-3.7.

474
00:53:21,197 --> 00:53:22,665
Request.

475
00:53:22,690 --> 00:53:26,385
DNA records:
children born 6-10-21.

476
00:53:26,724 --> 00:53:28,716
Looking for anomalies.

477
00:53:36,237 --> 00:53:38,008
You have
the satcrystal backup?

478
00:53:44,051 --> 00:53:45,634
Okay.

479
00:53:45,635 --> 00:53:46,634
Run it raw.

480
00:54:23,557 --> 00:54:25,649
Mere data makes a man.

481
00:54:27,529 --> 00:54:30,119
A and C and T and G.

482
00:54:30,553 --> 00:54:34,507
The alphabet of you.
All from four symbols.

483
00:54:36,050 --> 00:54:37,715
I'm only two:

484
00:54:41,110 --> 00:54:42,705
1 and 0.

485
00:54:42,995 --> 00:54:46,587
Half as much but twice
as elegant, sweetheart.

486
00:54:47,626 --> 00:54:49,718
You don't prefer your madam?

487
00:54:52,199 --> 00:54:53,830
You were listening.

488
00:54:54,756 --> 00:54:56,251
Maybe.

489
00:54:58,001 --> 00:55:00,897
You didn't like her enough
to tell her the truth.

490
00:55:01,579 --> 00:55:03,770
6, 10 and 21.

491
00:55:07,726 --> 00:55:09,718
There's nothin' to tell.

492
00:55:10,118 --> 00:55:13,226
How many times
have you told me that story?

493
00:55:15,329 --> 00:55:17,222
Your memory?

494
00:55:18,200 --> 00:55:20,475
The date carved beneath.

495
00:55:20,788 --> 00:55:23,026
6, 10 and 21.

496
00:55:24,929 --> 00:55:26,768
Coincidence?

497
00:55:30,741 --> 00:55:33,132
A dangerous coincidence.

498
00:55:36,631 --> 00:55:39,221
I always knew
you were special.

499
00:55:40,565 --> 00:55:42,596
Maybe this is how.

500
00:55:47,662 --> 00:55:49,333
A child.

501
00:55:49,852 --> 00:55:52,243
Of woman born.

502
00:55:53,352 --> 00:55:55,742
Pushed into the world.

503
00:55:56,819 --> 00:55:58,580
Wanted.

504
00:55:59,606 --> 00:56:01,201
Loved.

505
00:56:04,032 --> 00:56:06,223
Well, if it were true,

506
00:56:07,402 --> 00:56:10,082
I'd be hunted
for the rest of my life

507
00:56:10,083 --> 00:56:11,082
by someone just like me.

508
00:56:13,044 --> 00:56:15,335
It's okay to dream a little.

509
00:56:16,004 --> 00:56:17,527
Isn't it?

510
00:56:18,058 --> 00:56:19,840
Not if you're us.

511
00:56:25,039 --> 00:56:26,553
Stop.

512
00:56:27,182 --> 00:56:30,646
Put up 4847
and 2181, side-by-side.

513
00:56:36,533 --> 00:56:40,724
They're identical. Translate.

514
00:56:42,801 --> 00:56:44,694
A boy and a girl.

515
00:56:46,126 --> 00:56:47,733
It's impossible.

516
00:56:48,576 --> 00:56:50,022
Why?

517
00:56:50,619 --> 00:56:53,429
Two people
can't have identical DNA.

518
00:56:54,975 --> 00:56:58,818
One of these isn't real.
It's a copy.

519
00:57:03,583 --> 00:57:07,168
They were both processed
at the Morrill Cole Orphanage.

520
00:57:08,954 --> 00:57:11,145
It says the girl died there.

521
00:57:11,325 --> 00:57:13,218
Genetic disorder.

522
00:57:14,304 --> 00:57:16,197
Galatians Syndrome.

523
00:57:16,853 --> 00:57:18,617
And the boy...

524
00:57:20,582 --> 00:57:22,203
...disappears.

525
00:57:24,304 --> 00:57:26,197
Where's the orphanage?

526
00:57:28,521 --> 00:57:30,461
You wanna go for a ride?

527
00:58:46,440 --> 00:58:48,572
Well, here we are.

528
00:59:01,700 --> 00:59:03,403
Buckle up.

529
01:00:02,448 --> 01:00:04,091
"K"?

530
01:00:55,724 --> 01:00:57,261
"K"? "K"?

531
01:00:59,066 --> 01:01:00,667
"K"? "K"? "K"? "K"? "K"?

532
01:01:54,043 --> 01:01:55,737
Stay back.

533
01:02:10,860 --> 01:02:12,329
Fire again.

534
01:02:12,711 --> 01:02:14,267
Fire again.

535
01:02:15,981 --> 01:02:17,483
Fire.

536
01:02:28,482 --> 01:02:30,773
200 feet to the east.

537
01:02:32,662 --> 01:02:34,141
Fire.

538
01:02:35,947 --> 01:02:37,516
Go north.

539
01:02:39,482 --> 01:02:41,034
Fire.

540
01:02:41,720 --> 01:02:44,707
Stop. 20 degrees east.

541
01:02:46,497 --> 01:02:47,892
Stop.

542
01:02:48,189 --> 01:02:49,767
Zoom in.

543
01:02:51,106 --> 01:02:52,642
Closer.

544
01:02:55,853 --> 01:02:57,976
Oh, come on.

545
01:02:58,947 --> 01:03:00,453
Get up.

546
01:03:00,853 --> 01:03:02,664
Do your fucking job.

547
01:03:03,854 --> 01:03:05,648
Find the child.

548
01:03:41,639 --> 01:03:43,233
Watch the car.

549
01:05:21,919 --> 01:05:23,380
Every last piece,

550
01:05:23,405 --> 01:05:26,213
or I'll put you outside
where the sky is raining,

551
01:05:26,238 --> 01:05:28,230
where it's raining fire!

552
01:05:28,437 --> 01:05:30,154
You're in here to work.

553
01:05:30,185 --> 01:05:33,576
And if you're not working,
I don't need you.

554
01:05:33,673 --> 01:05:35,665
I don't need any of...

555
01:05:38,244 --> 01:05:39,752
Hi.

556
01:05:46,229 --> 01:05:49,091
The nickel
is for the colonial ships.

557
01:05:49,140 --> 01:05:51,519
Closest any of them
or any of us is gonna get

558
01:05:51,544 --> 01:05:54,956
to that grand life
off-world.

559
01:05:56,029 --> 01:05:58,584
And I encourage play, I do.

560
01:05:58,585 --> 01:05:59,584
Keeps 'em occupied and it
makes 'em nimble, right?

561
01:05:59,683 --> 01:06:02,074
But it's work.

562
01:06:02,877 --> 01:06:04,670
It's work that molds them
into a child worth havin'.

563
01:06:05,166 --> 01:06:08,651
So come on, now.

564
01:06:17,309 --> 01:06:18,803
What sort do you have in mind?

565
01:06:20,262 --> 01:06:22,255
'Cause I got all kinds.

566
01:06:25,766 --> 01:06:28,846
-Oh, no, no, no.
-I'm not buyin'.

567
01:06:31,395 --> 01:06:33,341
No, no, no.
This is just my game,

568
01:06:33,374 --> 01:06:36,457
and I play it fair.

569
01:06:36,481 --> 01:06:38,223
No. No, I mean,
bigger than you...

570
01:06:38,409 --> 01:06:40,202
Bigger than you
have tried to shut me down.

571
01:06:42,314 --> 01:06:44,633
Bigger than you.

572
01:06:44,658 --> 01:06:46,821
And they were men, at that.

573
01:06:46,954 --> 01:06:49,016
A little boy came through here
about 30 years back.

574
01:06:51,050 --> 01:06:54,237
-I need to see your records.
-Hmm.

575
01:06:54,633 --> 01:06:56,725
Legitimate placements,
private sales, everything.

576
01:06:57,779 --> 01:07:00,667
Don't keep records
that far back.

577
01:07:00,741 --> 01:07:02,832
-You don't?
-I don't.

578
01:07:02,857 --> 01:07:04,750
Sorry.

579
01:07:06,815 --> 01:07:08,869
Can't help you.

580
01:07:08,870 --> 01:07:09,869
- You can't?
- Nope.

581
01:07:13,345 --> 01:07:15,238
I think you can.

582
01:07:19,815 --> 01:07:21,493
I think someone like you
keeps a long memory.

583
01:07:23,603 --> 01:07:26,549
Now you can tell me
what you remember,

584
01:07:26,574 --> 01:07:28,559
or I can put a hole right here
and take a look.

585
01:07:28,584 --> 01:07:31,660
They were laughin'
and what was it you said?

586
01:07:45,307 --> 01:07:48,154
What did you say?

587
01:08:06,957 --> 01:08:08,716
Are you comin'?

588
01:08:19,384 --> 01:08:20,976
Where is it?

589
01:08:24,049 --> 01:08:25,530
Oh, God.

590
01:08:30,720 --> 01:08:32,414
Where, where, where, where?

591
01:08:34,731 --> 01:08:36,987
I don't see it. Here.

592
01:08:45,848 --> 01:08:47,417
It's gone.

593
01:08:49,536 --> 01:08:52,126
It's the entire year.

594
01:08:53,674 --> 01:08:55,368
I didn't do that.

595
01:08:56,055 --> 01:08:57,584
That wasn't me.

596
01:09:01,088 --> 01:09:04,878
I didn't. Wasn't me.

597
01:13:38,240 --> 01:13:41,118
I always told you.

598
01:13:41,119 --> 01:13:42,119
You're special.

599
01:13:46,322 --> 01:13:48,425
Born.

600
01:13:48,426 --> 01:13:49,425
Not made.

601
01:13:53,452 --> 01:13:55,296
Hidden with care.

602
01:13:58,644 --> 01:14:00,736
A real boy now.

603
01:14:03,322 --> 01:14:05,712
A real boy needs a real name.

604
01:14:07,111 --> 01:14:08,688
Joe.

605
01:14:10,289 --> 01:14:11,789
"Joe"?

606
01:14:11,844 --> 01:14:14,172
You're too important for "K."

607
01:14:14,967 --> 01:14:17,241
Your mother
would've named you.

608
01:14:20,142 --> 01:14:21,570
Joe.

609
01:14:23,725 --> 01:14:25,917
-Joe.
-Stop.

610
01:14:32,463 --> 01:14:35,474
How do I know if a memory
is an implant or not?

611
01:14:39,200 --> 01:14:41,159
Who makes the memories?

612
01:15:12,696 --> 01:15:14,589
Dr. Ana Stelline?

613
01:15:18,369 --> 01:15:19,876
A visitor.

614
01:15:22,351 --> 01:15:23,829
Is that okay?

615
01:15:24,540 --> 01:15:26,057
Yes.

616
01:15:27,725 --> 01:15:29,618
It's just unusual.

617
01:15:31,209 --> 01:15:35,690
Nice to meet you,
Officer KD6-3.7.

618
01:15:39,868 --> 01:15:43,652
Sorry. It's a compromised
immune system.

619
01:15:44,148 --> 01:15:48,131
A life of freedom,
so long as it's behind glass.

620
01:15:48,492 --> 01:15:50,461
Is that why
you're not off-world?

621
01:15:50,496 --> 01:15:51,976
Yes.

622
01:15:52,049 --> 01:15:55,945
My parents had our passes
in pocket, but I took sick.

623
01:15:56,383 --> 01:16:01,154
So it was a new life for me.

624
01:16:01,467 --> 01:16:04,938
And they put me in my cage,

625
01:16:04,985 --> 01:16:08,242
filled it with everything
they could to keep me happy.

626
01:16:08,290 --> 01:16:12,828
Except company, of course.
And I was used to crowds.

627
01:16:16,098 --> 01:16:18,226
What can I help you with?

628
01:16:18,884 --> 01:16:21,894
Thought you might be able
to help me with a case.

629
01:16:22,822 --> 01:16:27,532
Oh, that's the most
interesting thing

630
01:16:27,533 --> 01:16:28,532
I've been offered
to help with in ages.

631
01:16:29,634 --> 01:16:33,020
Do you mind if I work
while you talk?

632
01:16:33,854 --> 01:16:35,361
Of course.

633
01:16:42,076 --> 01:16:44,566
I promise
I hear every word.

634
01:16:51,532 --> 01:16:54,517
They say you're the best
memory-maker there is.

635
01:16:54,618 --> 01:16:56,710
Well, then, they're kind.

636
01:16:57,902 --> 01:17:00,194
I love birthday parties.

637
01:17:03,858 --> 01:17:05,695
You work for Wallace.

638
01:17:06,064 --> 01:17:09,469
Subcontract.
I'm one of his suppliers.

639
01:17:09,916 --> 01:17:13,117
He offered to buy me out,

640
01:17:13,118 --> 01:17:14,117
but I take my freedom
where I can find it.

641
01:17:15,420 --> 01:17:17,114
Why are you so good?

642
01:17:17,709 --> 01:17:20,594
What makes your memories
so authentic?

643
01:17:20,666 --> 01:17:24,579
Well, there's a bit of
every artist in their work.

644
01:17:25,274 --> 01:17:29,157
But I was locked
in a sterile chamber at 8,

645
01:17:29,996 --> 01:17:32,440
so if I wanted to see
the world,

646
01:17:32,441 --> 01:17:33,440
I had to imagine it.

647
01:17:35,028 --> 01:17:37,870
Got very good at imagining.

648
01:17:39,507 --> 01:17:42,954
Wallace needs my talent
to maintain a stable product.

649
01:17:44,384 --> 01:17:46,575
I think it's only kind.

650
01:17:48,066 --> 01:17:50,355
Replicants live
such hard lives,

651
01:17:50,410 --> 01:17:53,479
made to do
what we'd rather not.

652
01:17:54,009 --> 01:17:55,642
I can't help your future,

653
01:17:55,675 --> 01:17:58,647
but I can give you
good memories

654
01:17:58,648 --> 01:17:59,647
to think back on and smile.

655
01:18:00,607 --> 01:18:02,431
It's nice.

656
01:18:02,432 --> 01:18:04,975
It's better than nice.
It feels authentic.

657
01:18:05,020 --> 01:18:07,928
And if you have
authentic memories,

658
01:18:08,314 --> 01:18:10,506
you have real human responses.

659
01:18:11,489 --> 01:18:13,174
Wouldn't you agree?

660
01:18:21,373 --> 01:18:23,361
Are they all constructed

661
01:18:23,763 --> 01:18:26,362
or do you ever use
ones that are real?

662
01:18:29,911 --> 01:18:33,020
It's illegal to use
real memories, officer.

663
01:18:35,031 --> 01:18:37,164
How can you tell
the difference?

664
01:18:37,206 --> 01:18:39,198
Can you tell if something

665
01:18:40,773 --> 01:18:42,395
really happened?

666
01:18:44,395 --> 01:18:46,686
They all think
it's about more detail.

667
01:18:47,343 --> 01:18:49,734
But that's not how
memory works.

668
01:18:50,574 --> 01:18:52,666
We recall with our feelings.

669
01:18:52,962 --> 01:18:56,149
Anything real
should be a mess.

670
01:18:57,846 --> 01:18:59,640
I can show you.

671
01:19:01,139 --> 01:19:02,634
Sit.

672
01:19:20,877 --> 01:19:25,447
Now, think about the memory
you want me to see.

673
01:19:26,207 --> 01:19:28,697
Not even that hard.
Just picture it.

674
01:19:29,790 --> 01:19:31,388
Let it play.

675
01:20:21,348 --> 01:20:23,639
Someone lived this, yes.

676
01:20:25,229 --> 01:20:26,814
This happened.

677
01:20:43,544 --> 01:20:45,278
I know it's real.

678
01:20:56,782 --> 01:20:58,485
I know it's real.

679
01:21:01,501 --> 01:21:04,804
God damn it!

680
01:21:48,912 --> 01:21:52,518
Officer KD6-3.7.

681
01:21:52,519 --> 01:21:53,518
Madam is calling you in.

682
01:21:53,549 --> 01:21:55,369
You're under arrest.
Drop your gun

683
01:21:55,394 --> 01:21:57,723
and keep your hands
where I can see 'em.

684
01:21:58,492 --> 01:21:59,586
- Cells.
- Cells.

685
01:21:59,587 --> 01:22:01,377
Have you ever
been in an institution?

686
01:22:01,378 --> 01:22:02,572
-Cells.
-Cells.

687
01:22:02,573 --> 01:22:04,558
When you're not
performing your duties,

688
01:22:04,559 --> 01:22:05,558
do they keep you
in a little box?

689
01:22:05,559 --> 01:22:06,653
-Cells.
-Cells.

690
01:22:06,654 --> 01:22:08,046
- Interlinked.
- Interlinked.

691
01:22:08,047 --> 01:22:10,032
What's it like
to hold the hand

692
01:22:10,033 --> 01:22:11,032
of someone you love?
Interlinked.

693
01:22:11,083 --> 01:22:13,823
Interlinked.

694
01:22:13,919 --> 01:22:15,083
Within cells interlinked.

695
01:22:15,084 --> 01:22:16,083
Within cells interlinked.

696
01:22:16,110 --> 01:22:17,303
- Dreadfully.
- Dreadfully.

697
01:22:17,304 --> 01:22:19,293
What's it like to
be filled with dread?

698
01:22:19,294 --> 01:22:20,388
-Dreadfully.
- Dreadfully.

699
01:22:20,389 --> 01:22:22,478
Do you like being
separated from other people?

700
01:22:22,479 --> 01:22:23,573
-Distinct.
-Distinct.

701
01:22:23,574 --> 01:22:25,663
-Dreadfully distinct.
-Dreadfully distinct.

702
01:22:25,664 --> 01:22:26,758
-Dark.
-Dark.

703
01:22:26,759 --> 01:22:28,247
Within cells interlinked.

704
01:22:28,248 --> 01:22:29,247
Within the cells
interlinked.

705
01:22:29,248 --> 01:22:32,033
- Within one stem.
- Within one stem.

706
01:22:32,034 --> 01:22:33,323
And dreadfully distinct.

707
01:22:33,324 --> 01:22:34,323
And dreadfully distinct.

708
01:22:34,324 --> 01:22:35,915
- Against the dark.
- Against the dark.

709
01:22:35,940 --> 01:22:38,132
A tall white
fountain played.

710
01:22:38,902 --> 01:22:41,094
A tall white
fountain played.

711
01:22:43,519 --> 01:22:45,667
You're not even
close to baseline.

712
01:22:51,742 --> 01:22:53,635
Out! Close the door.

713
01:22:54,529 --> 01:22:56,621
What the fuck is with you?

714
01:22:56,826 --> 01:22:58,952
I put you on a case.

715
01:22:58,984 --> 01:23:01,413
I impressed on you
the importance of that case,

716
01:23:01,445 --> 01:23:04,210
and then we pick you up

717
01:23:04,211 --> 01:23:05,210
fucking around
outside an upgrade center?

718
01:23:06,627 --> 01:23:09,195
Scan said you didn't look like
you on the inside.

719
01:23:09,220 --> 01:23:11,174
Miles off your baseline.

720
01:23:11,205 --> 01:23:12,856
Do you know what that means?

721
01:23:12,881 --> 01:23:14,375
I found the kid.

722
01:23:19,031 --> 01:23:21,827
He was set up
like a standard Replicant,

723
01:23:21,828 --> 01:23:22,827
put on a service job.

724
01:23:25,155 --> 01:23:27,337
Even he didn't know
who he was.

725
01:23:29,342 --> 01:23:31,033
-And?
-And it's done.

726
01:23:31,058 --> 01:23:33,238
What does that mean,
"it's done"?

727
01:23:33,239 --> 01:23:34,238
What you asked.

728
01:23:35,636 --> 01:23:37,184
It's done.

729
01:23:44,992 --> 01:23:47,354
You just stopped a bomb
from goin' off.

730
01:23:48,928 --> 01:23:50,518
You did good.

731
01:23:52,727 --> 01:23:54,852
I can help you
get outta this station alive,

732
01:23:54,877 --> 01:23:57,666
but you have 48 hours
to get back on track.

733
01:23:57,931 --> 01:23:59,921
Surrender your gun and badge.

734
01:23:59,976 --> 01:24:03,163
And your next baseline test
is outta my hands.

735
01:24:05,006 --> 01:24:06,594
Thank you, madam.

736
01:24:38,640 --> 01:24:40,264
You were right.

737
01:24:47,001 --> 01:24:49,271
You were right
about everything.

738
01:24:49,881 --> 01:24:51,365
Shh.

739
01:25:17,657 --> 01:25:21,043
Thought you weren't
interested, worky man.

740
01:25:24,127 --> 01:25:26,219
You liked her. I could tell.

741
01:25:29,151 --> 01:25:30,667
It's okay.

742
01:25:31,393 --> 01:25:32,933
She's real.

743
01:25:35,076 --> 01:25:37,168
I wanna be real for you.

744
01:25:38,460 --> 01:25:40,501
You are real for me.

745
01:25:41,561 --> 01:25:43,653
You have a special lady here.

746
01:26:01,865 --> 01:26:03,337
Okay.

747
01:26:03,658 --> 01:26:05,177
Let's do it.

748
01:26:26,933 --> 01:26:28,469
Look at you.

749
01:26:28,724 --> 01:26:30,766
Quiet now,
I have to sync.

750
01:29:26,798 --> 01:29:30,085
Joi is
anything you want her to be.

751
01:29:32,115 --> 01:29:35,247
Joi goes anywhere
you want her to go.

752
01:30:05,240 --> 01:30:08,787
99.9% detoxified water.

753
01:30:38,552 --> 01:30:40,044
It's from a tree.

754
01:30:40,045 --> 01:30:41,741
I'm done with you.

755
01:30:42,664 --> 01:30:44,178
You can go now.

756
01:30:55,871 --> 01:30:57,328
Quiet, now.

757
01:30:57,961 --> 01:30:59,655
I've been inside you.

758
01:31:00,305 --> 01:31:02,696
Not so much there
as you think.

759
01:31:21,749 --> 01:31:23,221
Coffee?

760
01:31:29,046 --> 01:31:31,260
They'll be comin'
after me soon.

761
01:31:40,009 --> 01:31:41,670
I'm coming with you.

762
01:31:42,499 --> 01:31:44,123
But not like this.

763
01:31:44,708 --> 01:31:46,878
If they come here
looking for you,

764
01:31:46,903 --> 01:31:49,278
they'll have access
to all my memories.

765
01:31:50,054 --> 01:31:52,629
You have to delete me
from the console.

766
01:31:53,638 --> 01:31:55,178
My present.

767
01:31:57,198 --> 01:31:58,740
Put me there.

768
01:32:00,912 --> 01:32:02,606
I can't do that.

769
01:32:04,095 --> 01:32:05,764
Think about it.

770
01:32:06,639 --> 01:32:09,291
If anything happens to this,
that's it.

771
01:32:10,322 --> 01:32:11,838
You're gone.

772
01:32:12,014 --> 01:32:13,525
Yes.

773
01:32:14,669 --> 01:32:16,213
Like a real girl.

774
01:32:22,265 --> 01:32:23,747
Please.

775
01:32:26,844 --> 01:32:28,637
Joe, please.

776
01:32:29,730 --> 01:32:31,407
I want this.

777
01:32:35,311 --> 01:32:37,118
But I can't do it myself.

778
01:32:55,065 --> 01:32:56,694
Break the antenna.

779
01:33:36,939 --> 01:33:38,722
I don't need a real horse.

780
01:33:41,617 --> 01:33:43,917
I don't need a real horse.
I just...

781
01:33:44,480 --> 01:33:45,989
I just wanna find out
where it's from.

782
01:33:45,990 --> 01:33:46,989
Okay.

783
01:33:56,623 --> 01:33:58,413
Radiation from a reactor?

784
01:34:06,093 --> 01:34:08,170
It matches a dirty bomb.

785
01:34:16,131 --> 01:34:18,701
There's only one place
that dirty.

786
01:34:20,212 --> 01:34:21,881
Nobody lives there.

787
01:35:12,765 --> 01:35:14,365
- Go to five.

788
01:35:15,055 --> 01:35:17,396
Four, 30 degrees to the left.

789
01:35:19,756 --> 01:35:21,279
Tilt up.

790
01:35:23,844 --> 01:35:25,755
Elevate to 400 feet.

791
01:35:31,677 --> 01:35:33,669
Radiation analysis.

792
01:35:36,554 --> 01:35:38,108
Move forward.

793
01:35:44,915 --> 01:35:46,413
Tilt up.

794
01:35:46,806 --> 01:35:48,285
Stop.

795
01:35:50,190 --> 01:35:51,758
Move forward.

796
01:35:52,479 --> 01:35:53,992
Go to five.

797
01:35:55,143 --> 01:35:57,102
Seven, move forward.

798
01:36:02,287 --> 01:36:03,731
Six.

799
01:36:05,059 --> 01:36:06,543
Stop.

800
01:36:09,132 --> 01:36:10,716
Go to seven.

801
01:36:11,329 --> 01:36:12,756
Eight.

802
01:36:13,718 --> 01:36:15,185
Nine.

803
01:36:18,855 --> 01:36:20,365
Heat analysis.

804
01:36:28,447 --> 01:36:29,905
Life.

805
01:36:30,501 --> 01:36:32,056
What is it?

806
01:36:32,690 --> 01:36:34,837
Guess we're about to find out.

807
01:36:44,933 --> 01:36:46,627
Too dark in here.

808
01:36:49,697 --> 01:36:51,211
I like him.

809
01:36:52,145 --> 01:36:53,719
He's a good boy.

810
01:36:54,948 --> 01:36:56,473
Where is he?

811
01:37:02,797 --> 01:37:04,299
I have no idea. He's off-duty.

812
01:37:05,437 --> 01:37:08,323
Check around.

813
01:37:08,424 --> 01:37:10,011
I checked

814
01:37:11,209 --> 01:37:13,273
anywhere a good boy
might go.

815
01:37:14,027 --> 01:37:15,622
You're too late.

816
01:37:18,652 --> 01:37:20,319
It's gone.

817
01:37:23,308 --> 01:37:25,101
He destroyed it.

818
01:37:27,335 --> 01:37:29,492
Everything about it.

819
01:37:29,946 --> 01:37:32,421
Well, except
for the box of bones

820
01:37:32,422 --> 01:37:33,421
that you already took.

821
01:37:37,401 --> 01:37:40,888
Which, I'll wager,
wasn't enough. Here you are.

822
01:37:48,733 --> 01:37:50,626
You tiny thing.

823
01:37:52,282 --> 01:37:55,644
In the face
of the fabulous new,

824
01:37:55,645 --> 01:37:56,644
your only thought
is to kill it?

825
01:37:57,308 --> 01:37:59,738
For fear of great change?

826
01:38:00,777 --> 01:38:03,767
You can't hold the tide
with a broom.

827
01:38:04,261 --> 01:38:06,154
Except that I did.

828
01:38:07,446 --> 01:38:09,140
Where is he?

829
01:38:12,820 --> 01:38:14,614
You're so sure.

830
01:38:15,890 --> 01:38:17,882
Because he told you.

831
01:38:18,295 --> 01:38:20,335
Because we never lie.

832
01:38:22,068 --> 01:38:25,247
I'm gonna tell Mr. Wallace
you tried to shoot me first.

833
01:38:26,104 --> 01:38:27,981
So I had to kill you.

834
01:38:32,628 --> 01:38:34,790
Then do what you gotta do.

835
01:38:35,813 --> 01:38:37,352
Madam.

836
01:39:09,180 --> 01:39:12,357
Location: Officer KD6-3.7.

837
01:44:00,390 --> 01:44:05,752
"Mightn't happen to have

838
01:44:06,262 --> 01:44:07,766
"a piece of cheese
about you, now?"

839
01:44:22,833 --> 01:44:24,403
Would you, boy?

840
01:44:29,766 --> 01:44:31,000
Treasure Island?

841
01:44:31,264 --> 01:44:32,844
He reads.

842
01:44:33,933 --> 01:44:35,462
That's good.

843
01:44:36,421 --> 01:44:37,939
Me, too.

844
01:44:38,946 --> 01:44:42,133
Not much else to do
around here at night anymore.

845
01:44:44,881 --> 01:44:49,319
"Many is the night
I dream of cheese,

846
01:44:52,943 --> 01:44:56,169
"toasted, mostly."

847
01:44:59,512 --> 01:45:01,237
What are you doing here?

848
01:45:04,389 --> 01:45:06,083
I heard the piano.

849
01:45:07,995 --> 01:45:09,590
Don't lie.

850
01:45:10,722 --> 01:45:12,224
It's rude.

851
01:45:14,273 --> 01:45:16,066
You're a cop.

852
01:45:17,230 --> 01:45:20,082
-I'm not here to take you in.
-Oh, yeah?

853
01:45:22,895 --> 01:45:24,416
Then, what?

854
01:45:26,509 --> 01:45:28,701
I just have some questions.

855
01:45:29,273 --> 01:45:30,966
What questions?

856
01:45:48,753 --> 01:45:50,250
Stay.

857
01:48:23,332 --> 01:48:26,446
Look,
I don't wanna hurt you.

858
01:48:26,678 --> 01:48:28,671
But you're not makin' it easy.

859
01:49:01,278 --> 01:49:06,458
â™ھ Like a river flows

860
01:49:06,459 --> 01:49:07,458
â™ھ Surely to the sea

861
01:49:08,411 --> 01:49:11,942
â™ھ Darling, so it goes

862
01:49:12,008 --> 01:49:17,068
â™ھ Some things are meant to be

863
01:49:17,800 --> 01:49:19,594
I like this song.

864
01:49:19,655 --> 01:49:23,462
â™ھ Take my hand

865
01:49:25,254 --> 01:49:30,072
â™ھ Take my whole life, too

866
01:49:30,129 --> 01:49:33,166
We could keep at this,
or we could get a drink.

867
01:49:33,190 --> 01:49:38,263
â™ھ For I can't help

868
01:49:38,685 --> 01:49:45,152
â™ھ Falling in love with you â™ھ

869
01:49:45,763 --> 01:49:47,344
I'll take the drink.

870
01:49:55,722 --> 01:49:57,615
This is really somethin'.

871
01:49:57,860 --> 01:49:59,653
The whole town
was somethin'.

872
01:50:00,102 --> 01:50:01,630
One time.

873
01:50:03,585 --> 01:50:05,578
Forget your troubles,

874
01:50:06,671 --> 01:50:08,564
see a show,

875
01:50:10,184 --> 01:50:12,077
gamble a little.

876
01:50:14,641 --> 01:50:17,131
Win some money,
lose some money.

877
01:50:18,033 --> 01:50:21,322
They made money
seem like candy.

878
01:50:21,700 --> 01:50:23,291
You like whiskey?

879
01:50:23,827 --> 01:50:27,009
I've got millions

880
01:50:27,010 --> 01:50:28,009
of bottles of whiskey.

881
01:50:42,404 --> 01:50:43,897
Here.

882
01:50:44,693 --> 01:50:46,257
Bleeding.

883
01:50:58,926 --> 01:51:00,372
Is it real?

884
01:51:01,016 --> 01:51:02,511
I don't know.

885
01:51:02,663 --> 01:51:04,177
Ask him.

886
01:51:20,823 --> 01:51:22,319
Ya got a name?

887
01:51:24,269 --> 01:51:27,067
Officer KD6-3.7.

888
01:51:27,514 --> 01:51:29,523
That's not a name.
That's a serial number.

889
01:51:31,573 --> 01:51:33,048
All right.

890
01:51:35,555 --> 01:51:37,063
Joe.

891
01:51:37,208 --> 01:51:39,157
What do you want, Joe?

892
01:51:40,331 --> 01:51:43,428
- I wanna ask you some questions.
- Like what?

893
01:51:49,887 --> 01:51:51,730
Like, what was her name?

894
01:51:51,977 --> 01:51:53,738
The mother of your child.

895
01:52:00,867 --> 01:52:02,760
What was she like?

896
01:52:13,397 --> 01:52:15,068
Did you live here together?

897
01:52:15,069 --> 01:52:16,686
Too many questions.

898
01:52:17,955 --> 01:52:20,248
I had your job.
I was good at it.

899
01:52:20,295 --> 01:52:22,782
- It was simpler then.
- Why are you making it complicated?

900
01:52:22,815 --> 01:52:25,374
- Why don't you just answer the question?
- What question?

901
01:52:25,399 --> 01:52:28,287
I didn't figure you,
as one for bullshit.

902
01:52:28,873 --> 01:52:30,667
What's her name?

903
01:52:43,834 --> 01:52:45,270
Rachael.

904
01:52:50,120 --> 01:52:52,113
Her name was Rachael.

905
01:52:56,106 --> 01:52:58,011
What happened to the kid?

906
01:53:00,953 --> 01:53:03,659
Who put it in the orphanage?
Was it you?

907
01:53:06,428 --> 01:53:08,619
I was long gone, by then.

908
01:53:12,101 --> 01:53:14,431
You didn't even meet your own kid?

909
01:53:17,011 --> 01:53:18,485
Why?

910
01:53:19,298 --> 01:53:21,589
Because that was the plan.

911
01:53:23,695 --> 01:53:26,225
I showed them how to
scramble the records,

912
01:53:26,250 --> 01:53:27,921
cover their tracks.

913
01:53:28,900 --> 01:53:31,589
Everyone had a part.
Mine was to leave.

914
01:53:33,045 --> 01:53:35,704
Then the Blackout came,
baked over everything.

915
01:53:35,729 --> 01:53:38,107
Couldn't have found the child,
if I tried.

916
01:53:38,349 --> 01:53:39,932
Did you want to?

917
01:53:40,055 --> 01:53:42,541
- Not really.
- Why not?

918
01:53:42,634 --> 01:53:45,578
Because we were being hunted!

919
01:53:45,743 --> 01:53:48,289
I didn't want our child found.

920
01:53:48,530 --> 01:53:51,555
Taken apart. Dissected!

921
01:53:55,597 --> 01:53:58,441
Sometimes, to love someone...

922
01:54:00,573 --> 01:54:02,468
you gotta be a stranger.

923
01:54:23,705 --> 01:54:25,237
To strangers!

924
01:54:42,565 --> 01:54:46,003
â™ھ It's quarter to three,

925
01:54:46,291 --> 01:54:49,442
â™ھ there's no one in the place

926
01:54:50,036 --> 01:54:52,252
â™ھ except you and me

927
01:54:56,538 --> 01:54:59,121
So, set 'em up, Joe,

928
01:55:00,657 --> 01:55:03,277
â™ھ I got a little story...

929
01:55:05,791 --> 01:55:08,112
â™ھ you oughtta know

930
01:55:11,113 --> 01:55:13,853
â™ھ We're drinkin', my friend,

931
01:55:15,222 --> 01:55:17,009
â™ھ to the end

932
01:55:18,853 --> 01:55:21,921
â™ھ of a brief episode

933
01:55:24,965 --> 01:55:28,166
â™ھ Make it one for my baby

934
01:55:31,273 --> 01:55:33,703
â™ھ and one more for the road.

935
01:56:37,032 --> 01:56:38,561
What'd you do?

936
01:56:38,831 --> 01:56:40,625
Who'd you bring?

937
01:56:42,315 --> 01:56:44,811
- No one.
- Oh, yeah?

938
01:56:50,329 --> 01:56:52,206
Target locked.

939
01:56:54,227 --> 01:56:56,120
They know you're here.

940
01:56:57,344 --> 01:56:59,138
I came alone.

941
01:59:05,909 --> 01:59:07,509
Bad dog!

942
01:59:24,475 --> 01:59:26,006
Stop!

943
01:59:42,071 --> 01:59:44,725
I do hope you're satisfied
with our product.

944
01:59:45,287 --> 01:59:46,811
I love you.

945
02:03:00,540 --> 02:03:02,031
Hey.

946
02:03:02,531 --> 02:03:05,288
There's someone who wants
to meet you.

947
02:03:06,535 --> 02:03:08,229
You can trust us.

948
02:03:16,267 --> 02:03:19,244
You must want me to look up
and to the left.

949
02:03:25,026 --> 02:03:26,720
This is Freysa.

950
02:03:27,215 --> 02:03:29,524
She fought with Sapper on Calantha.

951
02:03:29,549 --> 02:03:31,181
I recognize you.

952
02:03:33,462 --> 02:03:35,834
Did you help him hide the child?

953
02:03:35,990 --> 02:03:37,357
Oh...

954
02:03:37,667 --> 02:03:39,373
I was there.

955
02:03:42,994 --> 02:03:45,186
I saw a miracle delivered.

956
02:03:46,425 --> 02:03:49,712
A perfect little face crying up at me.

957
02:03:50,307 --> 02:03:52,200
Mad as thunder.

958
02:04:05,635 --> 02:04:07,262
Were you with her?...

959
02:04:09,119 --> 02:04:10,602
Rachael?

960
02:04:10,726 --> 02:04:12,719
I held her as she died.

961
02:04:14,318 --> 02:04:15,879
We hid the child,

962
02:04:15,934 --> 02:04:18,668
and made a vow to keep our secret.

963
02:04:19,211 --> 02:04:21,701
That's why Sapper let you kill him.

964
02:04:22,908 --> 02:04:24,476
I knew...

965
02:04:24,608 --> 02:04:28,865
that baby meant we are more
than just slaves.

966
02:04:30,120 --> 02:04:32,710
If a baby can come from one of us,

967
02:04:32,977 --> 02:04:35,995
we are our own masters.

968
02:04:36,322 --> 02:04:38,713
"More human than humans".

969
02:04:40,839 --> 02:04:42,732
A revolution is coming.

970
02:04:43,076 --> 02:04:45,267
And we're building an army.

971
02:04:46,450 --> 02:04:48,642
I want to free our people.

972
02:04:57,094 --> 02:05:00,679
If you want to be free, join us.

973
02:05:06,023 --> 02:05:08,960
Deckard, Sapper, you, me;

974
02:05:08,985 --> 02:05:12,619
our lives mean nothing
next to a storm that's coming.

975
02:05:13,709 --> 02:05:18,099
Dying for the right cause is the
most human thing we can do.

976
02:05:21,054 --> 02:05:23,245
You led to Wallace to Deckard.

977
02:05:23,968 --> 02:05:27,844
You cannot allow Deckard
to lead Wallace to me.

978
02:05:28,431 --> 02:05:30,602
You must kill Deckard.

979
02:05:39,799 --> 02:05:42,688
Deckard only wanted
his baby to be safe.

980
02:05:43,436 --> 02:05:45,230
And she is.

981
02:05:47,131 --> 02:05:48,623
When the time comes,

982
02:05:48,655 --> 02:05:50,708
I will show her to the world.

983
02:05:50,742 --> 02:05:52,831
And se will lead our army.

984
02:05:52,878 --> 02:05:54,364
She?

985
02:05:54,547 --> 02:05:56,241
Of course.

986
02:05:56,615 --> 02:05:58,707
Rachael had a daughter.

987
02:05:59,899 --> 02:06:03,036
With my own eyes, I saw her come.

988
02:06:03,781 --> 02:06:06,957
I dressed her blue when
it was time for her to go.

989
02:06:06,982 --> 02:06:09,273
It was a boy that you hid.

990
02:06:11,100 --> 02:06:13,910
That is just a piece of the puzzle.

991
02:06:30,952 --> 02:06:33,250
You imagined it was you?

992
02:06:35,039 --> 02:06:36,398
Oh.

993
02:06:36,771 --> 02:06:38,289
You did.

994
02:06:38,917 --> 02:06:40,429
You did.

995
02:06:43,086 --> 02:06:45,178
We all wish it was us.

996
02:06:46,847 --> 02:06:48,740
That's why we believe.

997
02:07:05,276 --> 02:07:07,169
Someone lived this, yes.

998
02:07:09,572 --> 02:07:14,152
I showed them how to scramble
the records, cover their tracks.

999
02:07:14,250 --> 02:07:17,138
With my own eyes,
I saw her come.

1000
02:07:18,430 --> 02:07:22,115
I dressed her in blue when
it was time for her to go.

1001
02:07:22,856 --> 02:07:25,960
There's a bit of every
artist in their work.

1002
02:08:03,619 --> 02:08:05,711
Always jumping, that one.

1003
02:08:06,903 --> 02:08:10,063
Never a thought, what to do,
if it made land.

1004
02:08:11,190 --> 02:08:15,771
All the courage in the world
cannot alter fact.

1005
02:08:20,507 --> 02:08:25,685
I have wanted to meet you
for so very long.

1006
02:08:44,129 --> 02:08:46,718
You are a wonder to me,
Mr Deckard.

1007
02:08:52,627 --> 02:08:54,292
I had the lock.

1008
02:08:56,027 --> 02:08:58,218
I found the key.

1009
02:08:59,503 --> 02:09:04,006
Yet the pins do not align,
the door remains locked.

1010
02:09:06,722 --> 02:09:10,108
I need a specimen to reach it, Mr Deckard.

1011
02:09:13,889 --> 02:09:15,364
The child.

1012
02:09:16,775 --> 02:09:18,668
I need the child.

1013
02:09:19,861 --> 02:09:22,334
To teach them all to fly.

1014
02:09:30,786 --> 02:09:34,669
"And God remembered Rachel,

1015
02:09:36,682 --> 02:09:38,336
"He heeded her

1016
02:09:39,270 --> 02:09:41,163
"and opened her womb."

1017
02:09:41,880 --> 02:09:43,732
Do you like our owl?

1018
02:09:46,329 --> 02:09:48,176
It's artificial?

1019
02:09:49,124 --> 02:09:50,860
Of course it is.

1020
02:09:52,508 --> 02:09:54,321
Must be expensive.

1021
02:09:55,987 --> 02:09:57,440
Very.

1022
02:09:57,491 --> 02:09:59,185
I'm Rachael.

1023
02:09:59,674 --> 02:10:01,169
Deckard.

1024
02:10:13,126 --> 02:10:14,720
Is it the same,...

1025
02:10:16,197 --> 02:10:18,441
now as then,...

1026
02:10:21,273 --> 02:10:23,464
the moment you met her?

1027
02:10:33,217 --> 02:10:36,509
All these years you
looked back on that day,

1028
02:10:36,534 --> 02:10:39,580
drunk on the memory
of its perfection.

1029
02:10:42,871 --> 02:10:45,162
How shiny, her lips!

1030
02:10:45,267 --> 02:10:47,967
How instant, your connection!

1031
02:10:50,957 --> 02:10:52,693
Did it never occur to you,

1032
02:10:52,718 --> 02:10:55,942
that's why you were summoned
in the first place?

1033
02:10:57,392 --> 02:11:00,314
Designed to do nothing short of,
fall for her,

1034
02:11:00,339 --> 02:11:02,939
right then and there.

1035
02:11:05,209 --> 02:11:07,662
All to make that single,

1036
02:11:07,702 --> 02:11:09,193
perfect...

1037
02:11:09,240 --> 02:11:10,781
specimen.

1038
02:11:13,803 --> 02:11:16,592
That is, if you were designed.

1039
02:11:18,153 --> 02:11:19,661
Love,

1040
02:11:19,916 --> 02:11:22,704
or mathematical precision.

1041
02:11:28,330 --> 02:11:29,806
Yes?

1042
02:11:30,596 --> 02:11:32,103
No?

1043
02:11:36,587 --> 02:11:38,679
I know what's real.

1044
02:12:02,690 --> 02:12:06,073
It was very clever to keep
yourself empty of information.

1045
02:12:06,098 --> 02:12:09,683
And all it cost you was, everything.

1046
02:12:13,844 --> 02:12:16,135
But you can still help me.

1047
02:12:17,427 --> 02:12:20,614
You help help in the hiding.

1048
02:12:23,086 --> 02:12:24,959
Where did they go?

1049
02:12:26,677 --> 02:12:28,769
I know, you know something.

1050
02:12:29,817 --> 02:12:31,265
Help me...

1051
02:12:32,192 --> 02:12:35,744
and very, very good things
can come to you.

1052
02:12:41,415 --> 02:12:43,209
You don't have children.

1053
02:12:46,912 --> 02:12:48,308
Do you?

1054
02:12:48,781 --> 02:12:51,171
Oh, I have millions.

1055
02:12:53,559 --> 02:12:56,745
You think I have nothing to offer
but pain?

1056
02:12:57,041 --> 02:12:58,735
Only, I know...

1057
02:13:00,128 --> 02:13:01,722
you love pain.

1058
02:13:03,113 --> 02:13:07,550
Pain reminds you,
the joy you felt was real.

1059
02:13:09,574 --> 02:13:11,282
More joy, then!

1060
02:13:17,645 --> 02:13:19,637
Do not be afraid.

1061
02:13:34,473 --> 02:13:36,067
An angel...

1062
02:13:37,293 --> 02:13:39,186
made again.

1063
02:13:42,904 --> 02:13:44,431
For you.

1064
02:14:18,579 --> 02:14:20,295
Did you miss me?

1065
02:14:38,364 --> 02:14:40,125
Don't you love me?

1066
02:14:59,069 --> 02:15:00,768
Her eyes were green.

1067
02:15:18,280 --> 02:15:20,050
Off-world,...

1068
02:15:20,682 --> 02:15:23,670
I have everything I need
to make you talk.

1069
02:15:25,844 --> 02:15:28,235
You do not know what pain is, yet.

1070
02:15:30,124 --> 02:15:31,801
You will learn.

1071
02:15:43,759 --> 02:15:45,652
Hello handsome.

1072
02:16:02,471 --> 02:16:05,061
What day, hm?

1073
02:16:08,748 --> 02:16:10,641
You look lonely.

1074
02:16:11,728 --> 02:16:13,621
I can fix that.

1075
02:16:17,112 --> 02:16:19,937
You look like a good Joe.

1076
02:16:55,145 --> 02:17:00,463
Dying for the right cause is the
most human thing we can do.

1077
02:17:03,486 --> 02:17:05,877
Because you've
nevert seen a miracle.

1078
02:17:44,293 --> 02:17:47,665
You are entering Los Angeles Airport,
restricted airspace

1079
02:17:47,704 --> 02:17:49,224
Confirm your identity.

1080
02:17:49,249 --> 02:17:52,834
Transport S-14 Branch D, confirmed.

1081
02:17:53,216 --> 02:17:55,794
Base, this is 06 outbound...

1082
02:17:58,030 --> 02:17:59,724
Where are we going?

1083
02:18:00,717 --> 02:18:02,212
Home.

1084
02:18:57,239 --> 02:19:01,170
Drive 2 down.
Backup engaged.

1085
02:19:01,722 --> 02:19:03,169
Warning.

1086
02:19:03,194 --> 02:19:05,784
- Can we make it?
- We're too low!

1087
02:19:06,328 --> 02:19:07,912
Take us back!

1088
02:19:56,917 --> 02:19:58,486
Get us up!

1089
02:20:22,780 --> 02:20:24,359
Open the door.

1090
02:22:16,923 --> 02:22:18,655
I am the best one.

1091
02:22:59,572 --> 02:23:01,451
Off-world is waiting.

1092
02:25:14,648 --> 02:25:17,107
Joe. Joe!

1093
02:25:27,284 --> 02:25:28,801
Joe!

1094
02:26:07,931 --> 02:26:10,191
You should've let me die out there.

1095
02:26:11,162 --> 02:26:12,730
You did.

1096
02:26:16,490 --> 02:26:18,318
You drowned out there.

1097
02:26:24,039 --> 02:26:26,856
You're free to meet your daughter, now.

1098
02:27:51,385 --> 02:27:53,876
All the best memories are hers.

1099
02:28:03,000 --> 02:28:04,520
Why?

1100
02:28:07,073 --> 02:28:08,832
Who am I to you?

1101
02:28:18,027 --> 02:28:19,809
Go meet your daughter.

1102
02:28:25,969 --> 02:28:27,663
You OK?

1103
02:31:03,643 --> 02:31:05,245
Just a moment.

1104
02:31:07,724 --> 02:31:09,741
Beautiful, isn't it?
