1
00:05:00,575 --> 00:05:04,095
I hope you don't mind me
taking the liberty.

2
00:05:06,455 --> 00:05:08,712
I was careful
not to drag in any dirt.

3
00:05:08,861 --> 00:05:11,171
I don't mind the dirt.

4
00:05:11,888 --> 00:05:14,156
I do mind

5
00:05:15,619 --> 00:05:17,795
unannounced visits.

6
00:05:18,335 --> 00:05:20,975
You police?

7
00:05:23,504 --> 00:05:25,368
Are you Sapper Morton?
Civic number NK68514?

8
00:05:26,611 --> 00:05:31,350
I'm a farmer.

9
00:05:31,416 --> 00:05:33,346
I saw that.

10
00:05:33,590 --> 00:05:35,127
What do you farm?

11
00:05:35,655 --> 00:05:37,596
It's a protein farm.

12
00:05:44,621 --> 00:05:46,638
Wallace design.

13
00:05:47,111 --> 00:05:49,208
Is that what I smell?

14
00:05:50,756 --> 00:05:52,450
Grow that just for me.

15
00:05:53,002 --> 00:05:54,908
Garlic.

16
00:05:55,841 --> 00:05:57,531
Garlic.

17
00:05:57,532 --> 00:11:43,263
Go on, try some.

18
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:00,933
No, thank you.

19
00:06:01,735 --> 00:06:03,429
I prefer to keep
an empty stomach

20
00:06:05,217 --> 00:06:09,595
until the hard part
of the day is done.

21
00:06:12,123 --> 00:06:13,852
How long you been here?

22
00:06:13,877 --> 00:06:15,514
Since 2020.

23
00:06:16,774 --> 00:06:19,614
But you haven't always
been a farmer, have you?

24
00:06:21,232 --> 00:06:22,846
Your bag.

25
00:06:23,042 --> 00:06:25,231
It's colonial medical use.

26
00:06:25,342 --> 00:06:27,058
Military issue.

27
00:06:29,429 --> 00:06:32,280
Where were you? Calantha?

28
00:06:36,660 --> 00:06:38,391
Must have been brutal.

29
00:06:38,852 --> 00:06:41,080
Plan on taking me in?

30
00:06:43,770 --> 00:06:45,711
Let them take a look inside?

31
00:06:45,962 --> 00:06:47,457
Mr. Morton,

32
00:06:48,410 --> 00:06:50,900
if taking you in
is an option,

33
00:06:55,057 --> 00:06:57,946
I would much prefer that
to the alternative.

34
00:06:59,163 --> 00:07:02,384
I'm sure you knew
it would be someone in time.

35
00:07:04,117 --> 00:07:06,199
I'm sorry it had to be me.

36
00:07:09,835 --> 00:07:11,746
Good as any.

37
00:07:16,489 --> 00:07:18,481
Now, if you don't mind,

38
00:07:19,070 --> 00:07:22,161
if you could just look up
and to the left, please.

39
00:08:18,807 --> 00:08:20,895
Please don't get up.

40
00:08:31,742 --> 00:08:35,010
How's it feel
killing your own kind?

41
00:08:38,669 --> 00:08:42,176
I don't retire my own kind
because we don't run.

42
00:08:44,180 --> 00:08:46,021
Only older models do.

43
00:08:46,046 --> 00:08:50,537
And you new models
are happy scraping the shit

44
00:08:55,025 --> 00:08:57,709
because you've never
seen a miracle.

45
00:09:38,815 --> 00:09:40,907
Just photograph everything.

46
00:09:52,544 --> 00:09:54,437
Madam, please.

47
00:09:54,648 --> 00:09:57,513
Incoming LAPD re-codec hash.

48
00:10:00,451 --> 00:10:03,439
You're hurt.
I'm not payin' for that.

49
00:10:04,234 --> 00:10:06,425
-I'll glue it.
-And?

50
00:10:12,442 --> 00:10:14,382
One of the tail-end Nexus 8s.

51
00:10:14,413 --> 00:10:17,281
He looks like he could
take your head off.

52
00:10:17,282 --> 00:10:18,281
He tried.

53
00:10:18,306 --> 00:10:20,445
He went AWOL after Calantha

54
00:10:20,504 --> 00:10:23,882
with a few more in his outfit
I wouldn't mind closin' out.

55
00:10:24,110 --> 00:10:26,401
-Just him?
-Just him.

56
00:10:26,967 --> 00:10:29,308
Come on home
for your baseline.

57
00:10:32,993 --> 00:10:34,799
One moment, madam.

58
00:11:22,394 --> 00:11:24,884
30 meters to maximum depth.

59
00:11:40,465 --> 00:11:42,044
What is that?

60
00:11:47,256 --> 00:11:49,241
I'll send a dig team.

61
00:11:50,113 --> 00:11:52,062
Come on home before the storm.

62
00:13:09,564 --> 00:13:13,245
Officer KD6-3.7.

63
00:13:13,270 --> 00:13:15,362
-Let's begin. Ready?
- Yes, sir.

64
00:13:16,531 --> 00:13:18,164
Recite your baseline.

65
00:13:18,189 --> 00:13:21,376
And blood-black
nothingness began to spin

66
00:13:23,069 --> 00:13:25,726
A system of cells
interlinked within cells

67
00:13:25,751 --> 00:13:28,047
interlinked within cells

68
00:13:28,048 --> 00:13:29,047
interlinked within one stem.

69
00:13:29,072 --> 00:13:30,877
Fuck off, skin-job.

70
00:13:32,550 --> 00:13:36,301
And dreadfully distinct
Against the dark,

71
00:13:36,302 --> 00:13:37,301
a tall white fountain played.

72
00:13:38,464 --> 00:13:39,757
- Cells.
- Cells.

73
00:13:39,782 --> 00:13:41,689
Have you ever been
in an institution?

74
00:13:41,714 --> 00:13:43,006
-Cells.
- Cells.

75
00:13:43,007 --> 00:13:44,300
Do they
keep you in a cell?

76
00:13:44,301 --> 00:13:45,594
-Cells.
- Cells.

77
00:13:45,595 --> 00:13:47,481
When you're not
performing your duties,

78
00:13:47,482 --> 00:13:48,481
do they keep you
in a little box?

79
00:13:48,482 --> 00:13:49,575
-Cells.
- Cells.

80
00:13:49,576 --> 00:13:51,467
- Interlinked.
- Interlinked.

81
00:13:51,468 --> 00:13:53,308
What's it like to hold
the hand of someone you love?

82
00:13:53,309 --> 00:13:54,801
-Interlinked.
- Interlinked.

83
00:13:54,802 --> 00:13:56,642
Did they teach you
how to feel finger to finger?

84
00:13:56,643 --> 00:13:58,036
-Interlinked.
- Interlinked.

85
00:13:58,037 --> 00:13:59,728
Do you long for having
your heart interlinked?

86
00:13:59,729 --> 00:14:01,121
-Interlinked.
- Interlinked.

87
00:14:01,122 --> 00:14:02,913
Do you dream
about being interlinked?

88
00:14:02,914 --> 00:14:03,709
Interlinked.

89
00:14:03,710 --> 00:14:05,500
What's it like to hold
your child in your arms?

90
00:14:05,501 --> 00:14:06,745
-Interlinked.
- Interlinked.

91
00:14:06,746 --> 00:14:08,486
Do you feel that there's
a part of you that's missing?

92
00:14:08,487 --> 00:14:09,681
-Interlinked.
- Interlinked.

93
00:14:09,682 --> 00:14:12,368
- Within cells interlinked.
- Within cells interlinked.

94
00:14:12,369 --> 00:14:13,801
Why don't you
say that three times.

95
00:14:13,802 --> 00:14:14,801
Within cells interlinked.

96
00:14:14,828 --> 00:14:17,903
Within cells interlinked.

97
00:14:17,928 --> 00:14:19,910
Within cells interlinked.
Within cells interlinked.

98
00:14:22,865 --> 00:14:24,460
We're done.

99
00:14:25,744 --> 00:14:27,438
Constant "K."

100
00:14:27,941 --> 00:14:29,982
You can pick up your bonus.

101
00:14:31,118 --> 00:14:32,725
Thank you, sir.

102
00:14:32,787 --> 00:14:34,762
Caution, keep clear.

103
00:14:35,877 --> 00:14:37,943
Caution, keep clear.

104
00:14:40,935 --> 00:14:43,617
Connect to off-world

105
00:14:43,618 --> 00:14:44,617
any time, any place.

106
00:14:44,618 --> 00:14:47,105
Packages start at 20 minutes.

107
00:14:47,106 --> 00:14:48,900
Many options available.

108
00:14:53,638 --> 00:14:56,924
Joi goes anywhere
you want her to go.

109
00:14:57,420 --> 00:15:01,455
Connect to
off-world any time, any place.

110
00:15:44,836 --> 00:15:48,354
"K"? I didn't hear you.
You're early.

111
00:15:48,419 --> 00:15:50,411
You want me to come back?

112
00:15:50,639 --> 00:15:52,937
Just go scrub.

113
00:15:54,829 --> 00:15:56,561
Yes, ma'am.

114
00:15:58,268 --> 00:16:00,062
How was your meeting?

115
00:16:00,416 --> 00:16:02,441
The usual.

116
00:16:03,550 --> 00:16:05,543
How was your day?

117
00:16:06,298 --> 00:16:09,491
I'm getting cabin fever.

118
00:16:13,089 --> 00:16:15,380
99.9% detoxified water.

119
00:16:15,931 --> 00:16:17,923
I had an accident at work.
I think I ruined my shirt.

120
00:16:18,356 --> 00:16:20,326
I'm sure
I can fix that for you.

121
00:16:20,351 --> 00:16:22,356
Let me take a look at it.

122
00:16:28,258 --> 00:16:29,952
I need a drink.

123
00:16:30,837 --> 00:16:33,525
Do you want a drink first?

124
00:16:33,526 --> 00:16:34,525
Mmm-hmm.
Pour me one, will ya?

125
00:16:36,234 --> 00:16:37,828
I'm trying a new recipe.

126
00:16:37,938 --> 00:16:39,940
I just need
a bit more practice.

127
00:16:39,965 --> 00:16:41,594
Don't fuss.

128
00:16:44,108 --> 00:16:46,373
I should have
marinated it longer.

129
00:16:46,495 --> 00:16:48,303
I hope it isn't dry.

130
00:16:50,416 --> 00:16:54,106
Did you know
this song was released

131
00:16:54,107 --> 00:16:55,106
in 1966 on Reprise Records?

132
00:16:55,723 --> 00:16:57,954
It was number one
on the charts.

133
00:17:03,042 --> 00:17:04,626
It won't be much longer.

134
00:17:04,651 --> 00:17:07,222
Just putting on
the finishing touches.

135
00:17:11,077 --> 00:17:14,955
Okay, it's ready.
I hope you're gonna like it.

136
00:17:14,980 --> 00:17:16,938
I told you not to fuss.

137
00:17:18,742 --> 00:17:20,561
And yet...

138
00:17:23,146 --> 00:17:25,875
Voilأ ! Bon appأ©tit.

139
00:17:28,534 --> 00:17:30,586
I missed you, baby sweet.

140
00:17:32,431 --> 00:17:34,423
Honey, it's beautiful.

141
00:17:34,652 --> 00:17:36,516
Just put your feet up.

142
00:17:37,189 --> 00:17:38,982
Relax.

143
00:17:57,013 --> 00:17:59,005
Was a day, hmm?

144
00:18:00,218 --> 00:18:01,999
It was a day.

145
00:18:02,814 --> 00:18:04,776
Would you read to me?

146
00:18:06,112 --> 00:18:07,666
It'll make you feel better.

147
00:18:07,735 --> 00:18:11,165
-You hate that book.
-I don't wanna read either.

148
00:18:12,893 --> 00:18:14,220
Let's dance.

149
00:18:14,245 --> 00:18:16,801
Do you wanna dance, or do you
wanna open your present?

150
00:18:16,841 --> 00:18:18,436
What present?

151
00:18:22,257 --> 00:18:23,765
This one.

152
00:18:23,863 --> 00:18:25,515
What's the occasion?

153
00:18:25,646 --> 00:18:27,538
Let's just say

154
00:18:27,871 --> 00:18:31,145
-it's our anniversary.
-Is it?

155
00:18:32,152 --> 00:18:36,730
No, but let's just
say that it is.

156
00:18:37,359 --> 00:18:38,754
Okay?

157
00:18:42,296 --> 00:18:44,023
Happy anniversary.

158
00:18:45,099 --> 00:18:46,892
An emanator.

159
00:19:29,373 --> 00:19:30,809
Thank you.

160
00:19:30,849 --> 00:19:34,932
Honey, you can go anywhere
you want in the world now.

161
00:19:36,041 --> 00:19:38,158
Where do you wanna go first?

162
00:21:52,012 --> 00:21:54,515
I'm so happy
when I'm with you.

163
00:21:56,643 --> 00:21:58,811
You don't have to say that.

164
00:22:29,958 --> 00:22:32,739
The dig's come through.
We have a new lead.

165
00:22:33,436 --> 00:22:35,076
Get down here.

166
00:22:48,573 --> 00:22:52,746
Carbon read: 14.6 GPH.

167
00:23:12,633 --> 00:23:16,076
Your box
is a military footlocker

168
00:23:16,077 --> 00:23:17,076
issued to Sapper Morton,

169
00:23:17,411 --> 00:23:20,268
creatively repurposed
as an ossuary:

170
00:23:20,339 --> 00:23:21,956
a box of bones.

171
00:23:22,367 --> 00:23:24,359
Nothin' else in it but hair.

172
00:23:25,505 --> 00:23:28,786
The soil samples indicate that

173
00:23:28,787 --> 00:23:29,786
she's been buried
for 30 years.

174
00:23:30,351 --> 00:23:33,629
Bones all dismantled,
fully cleaned,

175
00:23:33,630 --> 00:23:34,629
meticulously laid to rest.

176
00:23:34,691 --> 00:23:36,286
"She"?

177
00:23:37,551 --> 00:23:39,468
Cause of death, Coco?

178
00:23:50,019 --> 00:23:53,643
No breaks,
no sign of trauma, except

179
00:23:54,427 --> 00:23:56,918
a fracture
through the ilium.

180
00:23:57,639 --> 00:24:00,584
It's a narrow birth canal.
Baby must have got stuck.

181
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:03,553
- She was pregnant?
- Hmm.

182
00:24:03,818 --> 00:24:06,510
So he didn't kill her?

183
00:24:06,511 --> 00:24:07,510
Mmm. She died in childbirth.

184
00:24:09,322 --> 00:24:10,848
What's that?

185
00:24:11,902 --> 00:24:13,442
Go back.

186
00:24:14,207 --> 00:24:15,731
Closer.

187
00:24:17,064 --> 00:24:18,658
Closer.

188
00:24:21,368 --> 00:24:23,022
What's that?

189
00:24:24,604 --> 00:24:25,997
Huh.

190
00:24:26,091 --> 00:24:29,508
Notching in the iliac crest.

191
00:24:30,037 --> 00:24:33,340
It's fine-point,
like a scalpel.

192
00:24:34,346 --> 00:24:36,997
That looks like
an emergency C-section.

193
00:24:37,463 --> 00:24:40,948
The cuts are clean.
No sign of a struggle.

194
00:24:41,718 --> 00:24:43,541
He was a combat medic.

195
00:24:44,273 --> 00:24:46,570
Maybe he tried to save her
and he just couldn't.

196
00:24:46,609 --> 00:24:48,658
He didn't seem like
the saving type.

197
00:24:48,683 --> 00:24:51,117
He went to the trouble
of burying her.

198
00:24:51,325 --> 00:24:53,466
A sentimental skin-job.

199
00:24:55,422 --> 00:24:56,856
Sorry.

200
00:24:57,267 --> 00:24:59,139
So where's the kid?

201
00:25:00,528 --> 00:25:02,410
You scan the whole field?

202
00:25:02,449 --> 00:25:04,066
Just dirt and worms.

203
00:25:04,067 --> 00:25:05,066
No other bodies.

204
00:25:05,091 --> 00:25:06,722
Maybe he ate it.

205
00:25:55,588 --> 00:25:57,537
That's not possible.

206
00:26:00,006 --> 00:26:01,899
She was a Replicant.

207
00:26:04,462 --> 00:26:06,124
Pregnant.

208
00:26:15,085 --> 00:26:19,161
The world is built on a wall.

209
00:26:19,162 --> 00:26:20,161
It separates kind.

210
00:26:21,288 --> 00:26:23,873
Tell either side
there's no wall,

211
00:26:23,874 --> 00:26:24,873
you bought a war.

212
00:26:25,503 --> 00:26:27,170
Or a slaughter.

213
00:26:30,896 --> 00:26:32,889
So, what you saw

214
00:26:34,885 --> 00:26:36,737
didn't happen.

215
00:26:38,468 --> 00:26:39,936
Yes, madam.

216
00:26:39,961 --> 00:26:42,846
It is my job to keep order.

217
00:26:42,962 --> 00:26:45,851
That's what we do here.
We keep order.

218
00:26:47,725 --> 00:26:49,419
You want it gone?

219
00:26:50,886 --> 00:26:52,577
Erase everything.

220
00:26:52,626 --> 00:26:54,444
Even the child?

221
00:26:54,445 --> 00:26:55,444
All trace.

222
00:26:59,678 --> 00:27:01,847
You have anything more to say?

223
00:27:03,513 --> 00:27:06,573
I've never retired something
that was born before.

224
00:27:07,564 --> 00:27:09,452
What's the difference?

225
00:27:13,367 --> 00:27:15,857
To be born is to have a soul,
I guess.

226
00:27:16,934 --> 00:27:18,827
Are you telling me no?

227
00:27:19,807 --> 00:27:22,358
I wasn't aware
that was an option, madam.

228
00:27:22,394 --> 00:27:24,030
Attaboy.

229
00:27:27,096 --> 00:27:28,492
Hey.

230
00:27:28,673 --> 00:27:30,864
You've been getting on fine
without one.

231
00:27:31,255 --> 00:27:32,810
What's that, madam?

232
00:27:33,060 --> 00:27:34,652
A soul.

233
00:28:21,384 --> 00:28:26,362
And you new models
are happy scraping the shit

234
00:28:28,473 --> 00:28:31,019
because you've never seen
a miracle.

235
00:28:55,022 --> 00:28:57,589
Just checking in
on an old serial number.

236
00:29:02,479 --> 00:29:04,372
Confirmation DNA?

237
00:29:05,294 --> 00:29:07,068
I got hair.

238
00:29:24,091 --> 00:29:27,532
Oh! An old one.

239
00:29:28,195 --> 00:29:30,064
Pre-Blackout. Huh.

240
00:29:31,244 --> 00:29:33,436
That's gonna be tough.

241
00:29:34,397 --> 00:29:36,883
Not much from then.

242
00:29:36,884 --> 00:29:37,883
And what's there is

243
00:29:38,538 --> 00:29:40,332
thick milky.

244
00:29:41,212 --> 00:29:44,097
You can customize them
as much as you'd like.

245
00:29:44,473 --> 00:29:46,863
As human
as you want them to be.

246
00:29:47,354 --> 00:29:50,651
But your operation is strictly
a drill site, isn't it?

247
00:29:50,966 --> 00:29:54,348
I wouldn't waste your money
on intelligence,

248
00:29:54,349 --> 00:29:55,348
attachment or appeal.

249
00:29:56,057 --> 00:29:59,774
Unless you'd like to add some
pleasure models to your order.

250
00:30:13,096 --> 00:30:16,273
Would it be possible to
reschedule this call, please?

251
00:30:18,735 --> 00:30:21,188
Everyone remembers

252
00:30:21,189 --> 00:30:22,188
where they were
at the Blackout. You?

253
00:30:22,220 --> 00:30:24,572
That was a little
before my time.

254
00:30:24,628 --> 00:30:27,110
Mmm. I was home with my folks,

255
00:30:27,244 --> 00:30:29,914
then ten days of darkness.
Every machine stopped cold.

256
00:30:29,939 --> 00:30:32,456
When the lights came back,
we were wiped clean.

257
00:30:32,481 --> 00:30:36,317
Photos, files, every bit of
data... Ffft! Gone.

258
00:30:36,350 --> 00:30:38,335
Bank records, too.

259
00:30:38,336 --> 00:30:39,335
Didn't mind that.

260
00:30:39,438 --> 00:30:41,527
It's funny it's only paper
that lasted.

261
00:30:41,551 --> 00:30:44,418
I mean, we had
everything on drives.

262
00:30:44,419 --> 00:30:45,417
Everything, everything,
everything! Huh.

263
00:30:46,803 --> 00:30:49,891
My mom still cries
over the lost baby pictures.

264
00:30:50,027 --> 00:30:52,326
Well, it's a shame. You

265
00:30:52,327 --> 00:30:53,326
-must have been adorable.
-Hmm... Ah.

266
00:30:53,413 --> 00:30:55,444
Uh...

267
00:30:59,574 --> 00:31:02,363
Pretty fractured.
Not much on it.

268
00:31:03,326 --> 00:31:05,866
One of the last gens,
pre-Prohibition.

269
00:31:06,113 --> 00:31:09,366
Standard issue.
Made by Tyrell.

270
00:31:10,010 --> 00:31:11,545
And?

271
00:31:11,786 --> 00:31:13,874
Unremarkable.

272
00:31:13,875 --> 00:31:14,874
"Unremarkable"?

273
00:31:15,047 --> 00:31:17,987
There must be something
else we can find for him.

274
00:31:25,352 --> 00:31:27,942
Another prodigal
serial number returns.

275
00:31:29,473 --> 00:31:32,361
A 30-year-old open case
finally closed.

276
00:31:32,910 --> 00:31:34,749
Thank you, officer.

277
00:31:35,674 --> 00:31:38,089
I'm here for Mr. Wallace.
I'm Luv.

278
00:31:40,245 --> 00:31:41,980
He named you.

279
00:31:42,620 --> 00:31:44,456
Must be special.

280
00:31:45,046 --> 00:31:46,972
I'm here for Mr. Wallace.

281
00:31:46,973 --> 00:31:47,972
Follow me.

282
00:31:54,386 --> 00:31:57,872
The ancient models
give the entire endeavor
a bad name.

283
00:31:59,164 --> 00:32:03,844
What a gift, don't you think,
from Mr. Wallace to the world?

284
00:32:06,953 --> 00:32:09,708
The outer colonies
would never have flourished

285
00:32:09,709 --> 00:32:10,708
had he not bought Tyrell,

286
00:32:10,756 --> 00:32:12,848
revivified the technology.

287
00:32:13,695 --> 00:32:15,787
To say the least
of what we do.

288
00:32:19,117 --> 00:32:21,164
I see you're also a customer.

289
00:32:21,483 --> 00:32:24,000
Are you satisfied
with our product?

290
00:32:24,190 --> 00:32:27,874
She's very realistic.
Thank you.

291
00:32:28,700 --> 00:32:31,158
Here. All the junk is in here.

292
00:32:31,479 --> 00:32:34,368
Lucky for you,
Mr. Wallace is a data hoarder.

293
00:32:46,877 --> 00:32:49,116
No one's been
down here in ages.

294
00:32:52,055 --> 00:32:53,881
Sorry about that.

295
00:33:05,222 --> 00:33:08,855
All our memory bearings
from the time.

296
00:33:08,856 --> 00:33:09,855
They were all damaged
in the Blackout.

297
00:33:10,204 --> 00:33:12,699
But there are
sometimes fragments.

298
00:33:28,492 --> 00:33:30,026
You got a little boy.

299
00:33:30,018 --> 00:33:31,743
He shows you
his butterfly collection,

300
00:33:31,744 --> 00:33:32,743
plus the killing jar.

301
00:33:32,775 --> 00:33:34,711
I'd take him
to the doctor.

302
00:33:37,118 --> 00:33:39,490
There's a wasp
crawling on your arm.

303
00:33:39,491 --> 00:33:40,490
I'd kill it.

304
00:33:42,526 --> 00:33:45,628
You're reading a magazine.

305
00:33:45,629 --> 00:33:46,628
You come across a full-page
nude photo of a girl.

306
00:33:46,659 --> 00:33:48,821
Is this testing
whether I'm a Replicant

307
00:33:48,822 --> 00:33:49,821
or a lesbian, Mr. Deckard?

308
00:33:49,846 --> 00:33:52,165
Just answer
the questions, please.

309
00:33:55,670 --> 00:33:59,352
It was unclear what she was,
at least to someone.

310
00:33:59,500 --> 00:34:01,109
This was a test.

311
00:34:01,697 --> 00:34:03,889
We were difficult
to spot then.

312
00:34:05,594 --> 00:34:08,833
Was there anything unusual
about how you found her?

313
00:34:08,983 --> 00:34:11,600
To warrant an official
investigation?

314
00:34:14,032 --> 00:34:17,172
You know how people are
about old serial numbers.

315
00:34:17,683 --> 00:34:20,296
Everyone just sleeps better

316
00:34:20,297 --> 00:34:21,296
when they know
where they got to.

317
00:34:24,052 --> 00:34:25,627
She likes him.

318
00:34:26,861 --> 00:34:28,369
Who?

319
00:34:28,530 --> 00:34:30,921
This Officer Deckard.

320
00:34:32,114 --> 00:34:34,119
She's trying to provoke him.

321
00:34:37,511 --> 00:34:40,897
It is invigorating being asked
personal questions.

322
00:34:41,194 --> 00:34:42,888
Makes one feel

323
00:34:44,119 --> 00:34:46,059
desired.

324
00:34:46,882 --> 00:34:49,089
Do you enjoy
your work, officer?

325
00:34:53,491 --> 00:34:55,914
Please thank Mr. Wallace
for your time.

326
00:35:08,184 --> 00:35:10,869
You worked
with Officer Deckard

327
00:35:10,870 --> 00:35:11,869
back in the day.

328
00:35:12,623 --> 00:35:14,691
What can you tell me
about him?

329
00:35:15,187 --> 00:35:17,379
He liked to work alone.

330
00:35:18,365 --> 00:35:20,210
So did I.

331
00:35:22,171 --> 00:35:25,358
So we worked together
to keep it that way.

332
00:35:26,606 --> 00:35:28,209
That was it.

333
00:35:29,194 --> 00:35:31,513
Anything else
you can tell me?

334
00:35:33,130 --> 00:35:35,481
He wasn't long for this world.

335
00:35:37,731 --> 00:35:39,345
How so?

336
00:35:41,474 --> 00:35:43,865
Something in his eyes.

337
00:35:46,963 --> 00:35:49,453
Any idea how I could
contact him?

338
00:35:49,749 --> 00:35:51,273
None.

339
00:35:52,636 --> 00:35:54,927
He's nyugdأ­jas.

340
00:35:58,020 --> 00:35:59,543
Retired.

341
00:36:00,895 --> 00:36:02,427
What happened?

342
00:36:02,452 --> 00:36:04,942
Probably got what he wanted.

343
00:36:07,176 --> 00:36:08,969
To be alone.

344
00:36:33,812 --> 00:36:35,805
Welcome back, sir.

345
00:36:37,142 --> 00:36:39,933
You wanted to review
the new model, sir,

346
00:36:39,934 --> 00:36:40,933
before shipment?

347
00:36:41,857 --> 00:36:45,265
An angel
should never enter

348
00:36:45,266 --> 00:36:46,265
the kingdom of heaven

349
00:36:46,750 --> 00:36:48,617
without a gift.

350
00:36:50,862 --> 00:36:54,348
Can you at least pronounce,
"A child is born"?

351
00:36:56,882 --> 00:36:58,507
Hmm.

352
00:37:05,266 --> 00:37:07,069
A new model.

353
00:37:14,561 --> 00:37:16,951
Well, let us see her, then.

354
00:38:05,364 --> 00:38:08,013
The first thought

355
00:38:10,598 --> 00:38:12,591
one tends to fear,

356
00:38:13,832 --> 00:38:15,824
to preserve the clay.

357
00:38:18,425 --> 00:38:20,318
It's fascinating.

358
00:38:21,344 --> 00:38:24,087
Before we even know
what we are,

359
00:38:26,362 --> 00:38:28,087
we fear to lose it.

360
00:38:29,750 --> 00:38:31,491
Happy birthday.

361
00:38:40,929 --> 00:38:42,415
Now, let's have a look at you.

362
00:39:34,415 --> 00:39:36,919
We make angels

363
00:39:37,919 --> 00:39:42,123
in the service
of civilization.

364
00:39:42,123 --> 00:39:45,393
Yes, there were
bad angels once.

365
00:39:45,393 --> 00:39:47,796
I make good angels now.

366
00:39:33,743 --> 00:39:37,940
That is how I took us
to nine new worlds.

367
00:39:41,006 --> 00:39:42,501
Nine.

368
00:39:44,060 --> 00:39:47,615
A child can count to nine
on fingers.

369
00:39:47,644 --> 00:39:50,482
We should own the stars.

370
00:39:50,514 --> 00:39:52,091
Yes, sir.

371
00:39:54,933 --> 00:39:57,381
Every leap
of civilization

372
00:39:57,406 --> 00:40:00,062
was built off the back
of a disposable workforce.

373
00:40:00,093 --> 00:40:03,099
We lost our stomach
for slaves

374
00:40:03,335 --> 00:40:05,410
unless engineered.

375
00:40:08,568 --> 00:40:10,859
But I can only make so many.

376
00:40:16,563 --> 00:40:18,954
That barren pasture,

377
00:40:19,679 --> 00:40:21,929
empty

378
00:40:21,930 --> 00:40:22,929
and salted...

379
00:40:24,886 --> 00:40:26,380
...right here.

380
00:40:28,477 --> 00:40:31,863
The dead space
between the stars.

381
00:40:33,893 --> 00:40:37,080
And this, the seat that
we must change for heaven.

382
00:40:42,074 --> 00:40:46,660
I cannot breed them.
So help me, I have tried.

383
00:40:47,462 --> 00:40:50,546
We need more Replicants
than can ever be assembled.

384
00:40:50,611 --> 00:40:54,217
Millions, so we can be
trillions more.

385
00:40:56,047 --> 00:40:59,010
We could storm Eden
and retake her.

386
00:41:11,374 --> 00:41:13,865
Tyrell's final trick:

387
00:41:14,360 --> 00:41:16,353
Procreation.

388
00:41:16,450 --> 00:41:19,836
Perfected, then lost.

389
00:41:20,929 --> 00:41:23,320
But there is a child.

390
00:41:25,906 --> 00:41:27,799
Bring it to me.

391
00:41:28,096 --> 00:41:29,789
Sir.

392
00:41:37,792 --> 00:41:39,984
The best angel of all.

393
00:41:41,359 --> 00:41:42,953
Aren't you, Luv?

394
00:43:00,883 --> 00:43:03,376
The man with the green jacket.

395
00:43:03,377 --> 50:43:06,415
The one who killed Sapper.
Find out what he knows.

396
00:43:25,644 --> 00:43:27,140
Hi.

397
00:43:28,102 --> 00:43:30,393
Hello, hello, A-Boy.

398
00:43:30,614 --> 00:43:32,408
You alone?

399
00:43:38,308 --> 00:43:41,409
It's okay.
It's fine.

400
00:43:46,944 --> 00:43:48,979
Wanna buy a lady a cigarette?

401
00:43:55,604 --> 00:43:57,837
Oh, you don't even smile.

402
00:44:00,082 --> 00:44:02,071
Didn't you hear your friends?

403
00:44:02,434 --> 00:44:04,440
Don't you know what I am?

404
00:44:04,549 --> 00:44:06,003
Yeah.

405
00:44:06,331 --> 00:44:08,324
Guy eating rice.

406
00:44:09,538 --> 00:44:11,045
What's that?

407
00:44:12,157 --> 00:44:13,717
It's a tree.

408
00:44:14,047 --> 00:44:16,836
Oh. Never seen a tree before.

409
00:44:18,696 --> 00:44:20,338
It's pretty.

410
00:44:22,218 --> 00:44:23,922
It's dead.

411
00:44:25,364 --> 00:44:29,845
Now, who keeps a dead tree?

412
00:44:33,146 --> 00:44:34,653
Hmm?

413
00:44:36,985 --> 00:44:38,875
You're not gonna kill me,
are you?

414
00:44:38,916 --> 00:44:42,302
Depends.
What's your model number?

415
00:44:42,501 --> 00:44:45,379
Why don't you look under
my eye and find out.

416
00:44:47,652 --> 00:44:49,028
Oh!

417
00:44:49,751 --> 00:44:51,833
You don't like real girls.

418
00:44:54,989 --> 00:44:57,878
Well, I'm always here.

419
00:48:36,777 --> 00:48:38,484
Hi.

420
00:48:39,917 --> 00:48:41,572
You can't take those.

421
00:48:41,729 --> 00:48:45,045
Of course not. Proper channels
and paperwork. It's all here.

422
00:48:45,046 --> 00:48:46,571
Hold this for me.

423
00:48:48,399 --> 00:48:50,392
-Mmm. Yep. Here you go.
-Mmm.

424
00:49:07,610 --> 00:49:09,404
Coco is dead.

425
00:49:11,453 --> 00:49:13,346
Bones are gone.

426
00:49:13,974 --> 00:49:17,780
It's out. Already out.
How long'd that take?

427
00:49:18,481 --> 00:49:21,546
So, what do you have for me?
And don't say nothing.

428
00:49:22,347 --> 00:49:24,046
I found that.

429
00:49:24,759 --> 00:49:26,298
A sock?

430
00:49:28,243 --> 00:49:30,452
-Where'd you find it?
-Sapper's.

431
00:49:30,482 --> 00:49:32,324
Anything else?

432
00:49:32,325 --> 00:49:33,324
I burned everything else.

433
00:49:33,355 --> 00:49:36,468
Then what's this?
What's that date?

434
00:49:36,469 --> 00:49:37,468
Is that a birthday?
Is that a death day?

435
00:49:37,501 --> 00:49:39,237
I don't know yet.

436
00:49:42,702 --> 00:49:45,553
Am I the only one that can see
the fuckin' sunrise here?

437
00:49:45,600 --> 00:49:48,489
This breaks the world, "K."

438
00:50:00,883 --> 00:50:03,413
You know,
I've known a lot of your kind.

439
00:50:05,575 --> 00:50:10,315
All useful, but with you,
I sometimes forget.

440
00:50:11,043 --> 00:50:13,842
We didn't have any of you
where I was a kid.

441
00:50:19,449 --> 00:50:21,939
Do you remember anything?

442
00:50:22,516 --> 00:50:25,140
Before you were under me,

443
00:50:25,141 --> 00:50:26,140
you have any memories
from before?

444
00:50:26,204 --> 00:50:28,495
I have memories,

445
00:50:30,054 --> 00:50:32,578
but they're not real.
They're just implants.

446
00:50:33,767 --> 00:50:36,352
Tell me one.

447
00:50:36,353 --> 00:50:37,352
From when you were a kid.

448
00:50:42,074 --> 00:50:44,791
I feel a little strange
sharing a childhood story,

449
00:50:44,816 --> 00:50:46,931
considering
I was never a child.

450
00:50:48,921 --> 00:50:52,400
Well, would it help you share
if I told you it was an order?

451
00:50:55,052 --> 00:50:57,802
I have one
about a toy that I had.

452
00:50:57,865 --> 00:50:59,559
A wooden horse.

453
00:51:00,909 --> 00:51:02,974
With an inscription
underneath.

454
00:51:05,985 --> 00:51:08,868
All I remember
is a group of boys

455
00:51:08,869 --> 00:51:09,868
trying to take it away
from me.

456
00:51:10,346 --> 00:51:11,859
So I run.

457
00:51:36,921 --> 00:51:38,797
I go looking for a place
to hide it,

458
00:51:38,828 --> 00:51:41,297
and the only place
is this dark furnace.

459
00:51:42,912 --> 00:51:46,397
It's very dark
and I'm very scared,

460
00:51:46,595 --> 00:51:48,981
but this horse is all I have,

461
00:51:48,982 --> 00:51:49,981
so I go in anyway.

462
00:52:02,520 --> 00:52:04,291
Later on, those kids find me,

463
00:52:04,316 --> 00:52:07,920
and they beat me to tell 'em
where it is, but I don't.

464
00:52:14,135 --> 00:52:15,659
And that's it.

465
00:52:16,486 --> 00:52:17,822
Hmm.

466
00:52:18,208 --> 00:52:20,814
Little "K,"
fighting for what's his.

467
00:52:22,426 --> 00:52:24,136
It's a good one.

468
00:52:30,635 --> 00:52:32,139
Look at me.

469
00:52:34,509 --> 00:52:37,398
We're all just lookin' out
for somethin' real.

470
00:52:42,364 --> 00:52:44,701
What happens if I finish that?

471
00:52:48,454 --> 00:52:50,857
Shouldn't I get back
to work, madam?

472
00:53:00,159 --> 00:53:02,350
Check back in after DNAbase.

473
00:53:15,776 --> 00:53:18,550
Officer KD6-3.7.

474
00:53:21,397 --> 00:53:22,865
Request.

475
00:53:22,890 --> 00:53:26,585
DNA records:
children born 6-10-21.

476
00:53:26,924 --> 00:53:28,916
Looking for anomalies.

477
00:53:36,437 --> 00:53:38,208
You have
the satcrystal backup?

478
00:53:44,251 --> 00:53:45,834
Okay.

479
00:53:45,835 --> 00:53:46,834
Run it raw.

480
00:54:23,757 --> 00:54:25,849
Mere data makes a man.

481
00:54:27,729 --> 00:54:30,319
A and C and T and G.

482
00:54:30,753 --> 00:54:34,707
The alphabet of you.
All from four symbols.

483
00:54:36,250 --> 00:54:37,915
I'm only two:

484
00:54:41,310 --> 00:54:42,905
1 and 0.

485
00:54:43,195 --> 00:54:46,787
Half as much but twice
as elegant, sweetheart.

486
00:54:47,826 --> 00:54:49,918
You don't prefer your madam?

487
00:54:52,399 --> 00:54:54,030
You were listening.

488
00:54:54,956 --> 00:54:56,451
Maybe.

489
00:54:58,201 --> 00:55:01,097
You didn't like her enough
to tell her the truth.

490
00:55:01,779 --> 00:55:03,970
6, 10 and 21.

491
00:55:07,926 --> 00:55:09,918
There's nothin' to tell.

492
00:55:10,318 --> 00:55:13,426
How many times
have you told me that story?

493
00:55:15,529 --> 00:55:17,422
Your memory?

494
00:55:18,400 --> 00:55:20,675
The date carved beneath.

495
00:55:20,988 --> 00:55:23,226
6, 10 and 21.

496
00:55:25,129 --> 00:55:26,968
Coincidence?

497
00:55:30,941 --> 00:55:33,332
A dangerous coincidence.

498
00:55:36,831 --> 00:55:39,421
I always knew
you were special.

499
00:55:40,765 --> 00:55:42,796
Maybe this is how.

500
00:55:47,862 --> 00:55:49,533
A child.

501
00:55:50,052 --> 00:55:52,443
Of woman born.

502
00:55:53,552 --> 00:55:55,942
Pushed into the world.

503
00:55:57,019 --> 00:55:58,780
Wanted.

504
00:55:59,806 --> 00:56:01,401
Loved.

505
00:56:04,232 --> 00:56:06,423
Well, if it were true,

506
00:56:07,602 --> 00:56:10,282
I'd be hunted
for the rest of my life

507
00:56:10,283 --> 00:56:11,282
by someone just like me.

508
00:56:13,244 --> 00:56:15,535
It's okay to dream a little.

509
00:56:16,204 --> 00:56:17,727
Isn't it?

510
00:56:18,258 --> 00:56:20,040
Not if you're us.

511
00:56:25,239 --> 00:56:26,753
Stop.

512
00:56:27,382 --> 00:56:30,846
Put up 4847
and 2181, side-by-side.

513
00:56:36,733 --> 00:56:40,924
They're identical. Translate.

514
00:56:43,001 --> 00:56:44,894
A boy and a girl.

515
00:56:46,326 --> 00:56:47,933
It's impossible.

516
00:56:48,776 --> 00:56:50,222
Why?

517
00:56:50,819 --> 00:56:53,629
Two people
can't have identical DNA.

518
00:56:55,175 --> 00:56:59,018
One of these isn't real.
It's a copy.

519
00:57:03,783 --> 00:57:07,368
They were both processed
at the Morrill Cole Orphanage.

520
00:57:09,154 --> 00:57:11,345
It says the girl died there.

521
00:57:11,525 --> 00:57:13,418
Genetic disorder.

522
00:57:14,504 --> 00:57:16,397
Galatians Syndrome.

523
00:57:17,053 --> 00:57:18,817
And the boy...

524
00:57:20,782 --> 00:57:22,403
...disappears.

525
00:57:24,504 --> 00:57:26,397
Where's the orphanage?

526
00:57:28,721 --> 00:57:30,661
You wanna go for a ride?

527
00:58:46,640 --> 00:58:48,772
Well, here we are.

528
00:59:01,900 --> 00:59:03,603
Buckle up.

529
01:00:02,648 --> 01:00:04,291
"K"?

530
01:00:55,924 --> 01:00:57,461
"K"? "K"?

531
01:00:59,266 --> 01:01:00,867
"K"? "K"? "K"? "K"? "K"?

532
01:01:54,243 --> 01:01:55,937
Stay back.

533
01:02:11,060 --> 01:02:12,529
Fire again.

534
01:02:12,911 --> 01:02:14,467
Fire again.

535
01:02:16,181 --> 01:02:17,683
Fire.

536
01:02:28,682 --> 01:02:30,973
200 feet to the east.

537
01:02:32,862 --> 01:02:34,341
Fire.

538
01:02:36,147 --> 01:02:37,716
Go north.

539
01:02:39,682 --> 01:02:41,234
Fire.

540
01:02:41,920 --> 01:02:44,907
Stop. 20 degrees east.

541
01:02:46,697 --> 01:02:48,092
Stop.

542
01:02:48,389 --> 01:02:49,967
Zoom in.

543
01:02:51,306 --> 01:02:52,842
Closer.

544
01:02:56,053 --> 01:02:58,176
Oh, come on.

545
01:02:59,147 --> 01:03:00,653
Get up.

546
01:03:01,053 --> 01:03:02,864
Do your fucking job.

547
01:03:04,054 --> 01:03:05,848
Find the child.

548
01:03:41,839 --> 01:03:43,433
Watch the car.

549
01:05:22,119 --> 01:05:23,580
Every last piece,

550
01:05:23,605 --> 01:05:26,413
or I'll put you outside
where the sky is raining,

551
01:05:26,438 --> 01:05:28,430
where it's raining fire!

552
01:05:28,637 --> 01:05:30,354
You're in here to work.

553
01:05:30,385 --> 01:05:33,776
And if you're not working,
I don't need you.

554
01:05:33,873 --> 01:05:35,865
I don't need any of...

555
01:05:38,444 --> 01:05:39,952
Hi.

556
01:05:46,429 --> 01:05:49,291
The nickel
is for the colonial ships.

557
01:05:49,340 --> 01:05:51,719
Closest any of them
or any of us is gonna get

558
01:05:51,744 --> 01:05:55,156
to that grand life
off-world.

559
01:05:56,229 --> 01:05:58,784
And I encourage play, I do.

560
01:05:58,785 --> 01:05:59,784
Keeps 'em occupied and it
makes 'em nimble, right?

561
01:05:59,883 --> 01:06:02,274
But it's work.

562
01:06:03,077 --> 01:06:04,870
It's work that molds them
into a child worth havin'.

563
01:06:05,366 --> 01:06:08,851
So come on, now.

564
01:06:17,509 --> 01:06:19,003
What sort do you have in mind?

565
01:06:20,462 --> 01:06:22,455
'Cause I got all kinds.

566
01:06:25,966 --> 01:06:29,046
-Oh, no, no, no.
-I'm not buyin'.

567
01:06:31,595 --> 01:06:33,541
No, no, no.
This is just my game,

568
01:06:33,574 --> 01:06:36,657
and I play it fair.

569
01:06:36,681 --> 01:06:38,423
No. No, I mean,
bigger than you...

570
01:06:38,609 --> 01:06:40,402
Bigger than you
have tried to shut me down.

571
01:06:42,514 --> 01:06:44,833
Bigger than you.

572
01:06:44,858 --> 01:06:47,021
And they were men, at that.

573
01:06:47,154 --> 01:06:49,216
A little boy came through here
about 30 years back.

574
01:06:51,250 --> 01:06:54,437
-I need to see your records.
-Hmm.

575
01:06:54,833 --> 01:06:56,925
Legitimate placements,
private sales, everything.

576
01:06:57,979 --> 01:07:00,867
Don't keep records
that far back.

577
01:07:00,941 --> 01:07:03,032
-You don't?
-I don't.

578
01:07:03,057 --> 01:07:04,950
Sorry.

579
01:07:07,015 --> 01:07:09,069
Can't help you.

580
01:07:09,070 --> 01:07:10,069
- You can't?
- Nope.

581
01:07:13,545 --> 01:07:15,438
I think you can.

582
01:07:20,015 --> 01:07:21,693
I think someone like you
keeps a long memory.

583
01:07:23,803 --> 01:07:26,749
Now you can tell me
what you remember,

584
01:07:26,774 --> 01:07:28,759
or I can put a hole right here
and take a look.

585
01:07:28,784 --> 01:07:31,860
They were laughin'
and what was it you said?

586
01:07:45,507 --> 01:07:48,354
What did you say?

587
01:08:07,157 --> 01:08:08,916
Are you comin'?

588
01:08:19,584 --> 01:08:21,176
Where is it?

589
01:08:24,249 --> 01:08:25,730
Oh, God.

590
01:08:30,920 --> 01:08:32,614
Where, where, where, where?

591
01:08:34,931 --> 01:08:37,187
I don't see it. Here.

592
01:08:46,048 --> 01:08:47,617
It's gone.

593
01:08:49,736 --> 01:08:52,326
It's the entire year.

594
01:08:53,874 --> 01:08:55,568
I didn't do that.

595
01:08:56,255 --> 01:08:57,784
That wasn't me.

596
01:09:01,288 --> 01:09:05,078
I didn't. Wasn't me.

597
01:13:38,440 --> 01:13:41,318
I always told you.

598
01:13:41,319 --> 01:13:42,319
You're special.

599
01:13:46,522 --> 01:13:48,625
Born.

600
01:13:48,626 --> 01:13:49,625
Not made.

601
01:13:53,652 --> 01:13:55,496
Hidden with care.

602
01:13:58,844 --> 01:14:00,936
A real boy now.

603
01:14:03,522 --> 01:14:05,912
A real boy needs a real name.

604
01:14:07,311 --> 01:14:08,888
Joe.

605
01:14:10,489 --> 01:14:11,989
"Joe"?

606
01:14:12,044 --> 01:14:14,372
You're too important for "K."

607
01:14:15,167 --> 01:14:17,441
Your mother
would've named you.

608
01:14:20,342 --> 01:14:21,770
Joe.

609
01:14:23,925 --> 01:14:26,117
-Joe.
-Stop.

610
01:14:32,663 --> 01:14:35,674
How do I know if a memory
is an implant or not?

611
01:14:39,400 --> 01:14:41,359
Who makes the memories?

612
01:15:12,896 --> 01:15:14,789
Dr. Ana Stelline?

613
01:15:18,569 --> 01:15:20,076
A visitor.

614
01:15:22,551 --> 01:15:24,029
Is that okay?

615
01:15:24,740 --> 01:15:26,257
Yes.

616
01:15:27,925 --> 01:15:29,818
It's just unusual.

617
01:15:31,409 --> 01:15:35,890
Nice to meet you,
Officer KD6-3.7.

618
01:15:40,068 --> 01:15:43,852
Sorry. It's a compromised
immune system.

619
01:15:44,348 --> 01:15:48,331
A life of freedom,
so long as it's behind glass.

620
01:15:48,692 --> 01:15:50,661
Is that why
you're not off-world?

621
01:15:50,696 --> 01:15:52,176
Yes.

622
01:15:52,249 --> 01:15:56,145
My parents had our passes
in pocket, but I took sick.

623
01:15:56,583 --> 01:16:01,354
So it was a new life for me.

624
01:16:01,667 --> 01:16:05,138
And they put me in my cage,

625
01:16:05,185 --> 01:16:08,442
filled it with everything
they could to keep me happy.

626
01:16:08,490 --> 01:16:13,028
Except company, of course.
And I was used to crowds.

627
01:16:16,298 --> 01:16:18,426
What can I help you with?

628
01:16:19,084 --> 01:16:22,094
Thought you might be able
to help me with a case.

629
01:16:23,022 --> 01:16:27,732
Oh, that's the most
interesting thing

630
01:16:27,733 --> 01:16:28,732
I've been offered
to help with in ages.

631
01:16:29,834 --> 01:16:33,220
Do you mind if I work
while you talk?

632
01:16:34,054 --> 01:16:35,561
Of course.

633
01:16:42,276 --> 01:16:44,766
I promise
I hear every word.

634
01:16:51,732 --> 01:16:54,717
They say you're the best
memory-maker there is.

635
01:16:54,818 --> 01:16:56,910
Well, then, they're kind.

636
01:16:58,102 --> 01:17:00,394
I love birthday parties.

637
01:17:04,058 --> 01:17:05,895
You work for Wallace.

638
01:17:06,264 --> 01:17:09,669
Subcontract.
I'm one of his suppliers.

639
01:17:10,116 --> 01:17:13,317
He offered to buy me out,

640
01:17:13,318 --> 01:17:14,317
but I take my freedom
where I can find it.

641
01:17:15,620 --> 01:17:17,314
Why are you so good?

642
01:17:17,909 --> 01:17:20,794
What makes your memories
so authentic?

643
01:17:20,866 --> 01:17:24,779
Well, there's a bit of
every artist in their work.

644
01:17:25,474 --> 01:17:29,357
But I was locked
in a sterile chamber at 8,

645
01:17:30,196 --> 01:17:32,640
so if I wanted to see
the world,

646
01:17:32,641 --> 01:17:33,640
I had to imagine it.

647
01:17:35,228 --> 01:17:38,070
Got very good at imagining.

648
01:17:39,707 --> 01:17:43,154
Wallace needs my talent
to maintain a stable product.

649
01:17:44,584 --> 01:17:46,775
I think it's only kind.

650
01:17:48,266 --> 01:17:50,555
Replicants live
such hard lives,

651
01:17:50,610 --> 01:17:53,679
made to do
what we'd rather not.

652
01:17:54,209 --> 01:17:55,842
I can't help your future,

653
01:17:55,875 --> 01:17:58,847
but I can give you
good memories

654
01:17:58,848 --> 01:17:59,847
to think back on and smile.

655
01:18:00,807 --> 01:18:02,631
It's nice.

656
01:18:02,632 --> 01:18:05,175
It's better than nice.
It feels authentic.

657
01:18:05,220 --> 01:18:08,128
And if you have
authentic memories,

658
01:18:08,514 --> 01:18:10,706
you have real human responses.

659
01:18:11,689 --> 01:18:13,374
Wouldn't you agree?

660
01:18:21,573 --> 01:18:23,561
Are they all constructed

661
01:18:23,963 --> 01:18:26,562
or do you ever use
ones that are real?

662
01:18:30,111 --> 01:18:33,220
It's illegal to use
real memories, officer.

663
01:18:35,231 --> 01:18:37,364
How can you tell
the difference?

664
01:18:37,406 --> 01:18:39,398
Can you tell if something

665
01:18:40,973 --> 01:18:42,595
really happened?

666
01:18:44,595 --> 01:18:46,886
They all think
it's about more detail.

667
01:18:47,543 --> 01:18:49,934
But that's not how
memory works.

668
01:18:50,774 --> 01:18:52,866
We recall with our feelings.

669
01:18:53,162 --> 01:18:56,349
Anything real
should be a mess.

670
01:18:58,046 --> 01:18:59,840
I can show you.

671
01:19:01,339 --> 01:19:02,834
Sit.

672
01:19:21,077 --> 01:19:25,647
Now, think about the memory
you want me to see.

673
01:19:26,407 --> 01:19:28,897
Not even that hard.
Just picture it.

674
01:19:29,990 --> 01:19:31,588
Let it play.

675
01:20:21,548 --> 01:20:23,839
Someone lived this, yes.

676
01:20:25,429 --> 01:20:27,014
This happened.

677
01:20:43,744 --> 01:20:45,478
I know it's real.

678
01:20:56,982 --> 01:20:58,685
I know it's real.

679
01:21:01,701 --> 01:21:05,004
God damn it!

680
01:21:49,112 --> 01:21:52,718
Officer KD6-3.7.

681
01:21:52,719 --> 01:21:53,718
Madam is calling you in.

682
01:21:53,749 --> 01:21:55,569
You're under arrest.
Drop your gun

683
01:21:55,594 --> 01:21:57,923
and keep your hands
where I can see 'em.

684
01:21:58,692 --> 01:21:59,786
- Cells.
- Cells.

685
01:21:59,787 --> 01:22:01,577
Have you ever
been in an institution?

686
01:22:01,578 --> 01:22:02,772
-Cells.
-Cells.

687
01:22:02,773 --> 01:22:04,758
When you're not
performing your duties,

688
01:22:04,759 --> 01:22:05,758
do they keep you
in a little box?

689
01:22:05,759 --> 01:22:06,853
-Cells.
-Cells.

690
01:22:06,854 --> 01:22:08,246
- Interlinked.
- Interlinked.

691
01:22:08,247 --> 01:22:10,232
What's it like
to hold the hand

692
01:22:10,233 --> 01:22:11,232
of someone you love?
Interlinked.

693
01:22:11,283 --> 01:22:14,023
Interlinked.

694
01:22:14,119 --> 01:22:15,283
Within cells interlinked.

695
01:22:15,284 --> 01:22:16,283
Within cells interlinked.

696
01:22:16,310 --> 01:22:17,503
- Dreadfully.
- Dreadfully.

697
01:22:17,504 --> 01:22:19,493
What's it like to
be filled with dread?

698
01:22:19,494 --> 01:22:20,588
-Dreadfully.
- Dreadfully.

699
01:22:20,589 --> 01:22:22,678
Do you like being
separated from other people?

700
01:22:22,679 --> 01:22:23,773
-Distinct.
-Distinct.

701
01:22:23,774 --> 01:22:25,863
-Dreadfully distinct.
-Dreadfully distinct.

702
01:22:25,864 --> 01:22:26,958
-Dark.
-Dark.

703
01:22:26,959 --> 01:22:28,447
Within cells interlinked.

704
01:22:28,448 --> 01:22:29,447
Within the cells
interlinked.

705
01:22:29,448 --> 01:22:32,233
- Within one stem.
- Within one stem.

706
01:22:32,234 --> 01:22:33,523
And dreadfully distinct.

707
01:22:33,524 --> 01:22:34,523
And dreadfully distinct.

708
01:22:34,524 --> 01:22:36,115
- Against the dark.
- Against the dark.

709
01:22:36,140 --> 01:22:38,332
A tall white
fountain played.

710
01:22:39,102 --> 01:22:41,294
A tall white
fountain played.

711
01:22:43,719 --> 01:22:45,867
You're not even
close to baseline.

712
01:22:51,942 --> 01:22:53,835
Out! Close the door.

713
01:22:54,729 --> 01:22:56,821
What the fuck is with you?

714
01:22:57,026 --> 01:22:59,152
I put you on a case.

715
01:22:59,184 --> 01:23:01,613
I impressed on you
the importance of that case,

716
01:23:01,645 --> 01:23:04,410
and then we pick you up

717
01:23:04,411 --> 01:23:05,410
fucking around
outside an upgrade center?

718
01:23:06,827 --> 01:23:09,395
Scan said you didn't look like
you on the inside.

719
01:23:09,420 --> 01:23:11,374
Miles off your baseline.

720
01:23:11,405 --> 01:23:13,056
Do you know what that means?

721
01:23:13,081 --> 01:23:14,575
I found the kid.

722
01:23:19,231 --> 01:23:22,027
He was set up
like a standard Replicant,

723
01:23:22,028 --> 01:23:23,027
put on a service job.

724
01:23:25,355 --> 01:23:27,537
Even he didn't know
who he was.

725
01:23:29,542 --> 01:23:31,233
-And?
-And it's done.

726
01:23:31,258 --> 01:23:33,438
What does that mean,
"it's done"?

727
01:23:33,439 --> 01:23:34,438
What you asked.

728
01:23:35,836 --> 01:23:37,384
It's done.

729
01:23:45,192 --> 01:23:47,554
You just stopped a bomb
from goin' off.

730
01:23:49,128 --> 01:23:50,718
You did good.

731
01:23:52,927 --> 01:23:55,052
I can help you
get outta this station alive,

732
01:23:55,077 --> 01:23:57,866
but you have 48 hours
to get back on track.

733
01:23:58,131 --> 01:24:00,121
Surrender your gun and badge.

734
01:24:00,176 --> 01:24:03,363
And your next baseline test
is outta my hands.

735
01:24:05,206 --> 01:24:06,794
Thank you, madam.

736
01:24:38,840 --> 01:24:40,464
You were right.

737
01:24:47,201 --> 01:24:49,471
You were right
about everything.

738
01:24:50,081 --> 01:24:51,565
Shh.

739
01:25:17,857 --> 01:25:21,243
Thought you weren't
interested, worky man.

740
01:25:24,327 --> 01:25:26,419
You liked her. I could tell.

741
01:25:29,351 --> 01:25:30,867
It's okay.

742
01:25:31,593 --> 01:25:33,133
She's real.

743
01:25:35,276 --> 01:25:37,368
I wanna be real for you.

744
01:25:38,660 --> 01:25:40,701
You are real for me.

745
01:25:41,761 --> 01:25:43,853
You have a special lady here.

746
01:26:02,065 --> 01:26:03,537
Okay.

747
01:26:03,858 --> 01:26:05,377
Let's do it.

748
01:26:27,133 --> 01:26:28,669
Look at you.

749
01:26:28,924 --> 01:26:30,966
Quiet now,
I have to sync.

750
01:29:26,998 --> 01:29:30,285
Joi is
anything you want her to be.

751
01:29:32,315 --> 01:29:35,447
Joi goes anywhere
you want her to go.

752
01:30:05,440 --> 01:30:08,987
99.9% detoxified water.

753
01:30:38,752 --> 01:30:40,244
It's from a tree.

754
01:30:40,245 --> 01:30:41,941
I'm done with you.

755
01:30:42,864 --> 01:30:44,378
You can go now.

756
01:30:56,071 --> 01:30:57,528
Quiet, now.

757
01:30:58,161 --> 01:30:59,855
I've been inside you.

758
01:31:00,505 --> 01:31:02,896
Not so much there
as you think.

759
01:31:21,949 --> 01:31:23,421
Coffee?

760
01:31:29,246 --> 01:31:31,460
They'll be comin'
after me soon.

761
01:31:40,209 --> 01:31:41,870
I'm coming with you.

762
01:31:42,699 --> 01:31:44,323
But not like this.

763
01:31:44,908 --> 01:31:47,078
If they come here
looking for you,

764
01:31:47,103 --> 01:31:49,478
they'll have access
to all my memories.

765
01:31:50,254 --> 01:31:52,829
You have to delete me
from the console.

766
01:31:53,838 --> 01:31:55,378
My present.

767
01:31:57,398 --> 01:31:58,940
Put me there.

768
01:32:01,112 --> 01:32:02,806
I can't do that.

769
01:32:04,295 --> 01:32:05,964
Think about it.

770
01:32:06,839 --> 01:32:09,491
If anything happens to this,
that's it.

771
01:32:10,522 --> 01:32:12,038
You're gone.

772
01:32:12,214 --> 01:32:13,725
Yes.

773
01:32:14,869 --> 01:32:16,413
Like a real girl.

774
01:32:22,465 --> 01:32:23,947
Please.

775
01:32:27,044 --> 01:32:28,837
Joe, please.

776
01:32:29,930 --> 01:32:31,607
I want this.

777
01:32:35,511 --> 01:32:37,318
But I can't do it myself.

778
01:32:55,265 --> 01:32:56,894
Break the antenna.

779
01:33:37,139 --> 01:33:38,922
I don't need a real horse.

780
01:33:41,817 --> 01:33:44,117
I don't need a real horse.
I just...

781
01:33:44,680 --> 01:33:46,189
I just wanna find out
where it's from.

782
01:33:46,190 --> 01:33:47,189
Okay.

783
01:33:56,823 --> 01:33:58,613
Radiation from a reactor?

784
01:34:06,293 --> 01:34:08,370
It matches a dirty bomb.

785
01:34:16,331 --> 01:34:18,901
There's only one place
that dirty.

786
01:34:20,412 --> 01:34:22,081
Nobody lives there.

787
01:35:12,965 --> 01:35:14,565
- Go to five.

788
01:35:15,255 --> 01:35:17,596
Four, 30 degrees to the left.

789
01:35:19,956 --> 01:35:21,479
Tilt up.

790
01:35:24,044 --> 01:35:25,955
Elevate to 400 feet.

791
01:35:31,877 --> 01:35:33,869
Radiation analysis.

792
01:35:36,754 --> 01:35:38,308
Move forward.

793
01:35:45,115 --> 01:35:46,613
Tilt up.

794
01:35:47,006 --> 01:35:48,485
Stop.

795
01:35:50,390 --> 01:35:51,958
Move forward.

796
01:35:52,679 --> 01:35:54,192
Go to five.

797
01:35:55,343 --> 01:35:57,302
Seven, move forward.

798
01:36:02,487 --> 01:36:03,931
Six.

799
01:36:05,259 --> 01:36:06,743
Stop.

800
01:36:09,332 --> 01:36:10,916
Go to seven.

801
01:36:11,529 --> 01:36:12,956
Eight.

802
01:36:13,918 --> 01:36:15,385
Nine.

803
01:36:19,055 --> 01:36:20,565
Heat analysis.

804
01:36:28,647 --> 01:36:30,105
Life.

805
01:36:30,701 --> 01:36:32,256
What is it?

806
01:36:32,890 --> 01:36:35,037
Guess we're about to find out.

807
01:36:45,133 --> 01:36:46,827
Too dark in here.

808
01:36:49,897 --> 01:36:51,411
I like him.

809
01:36:52,345 --> 01:36:53,919
He's a good boy.

810
01:36:55,148 --> 01:36:56,673
Where is he?

811
01:37:02,997 --> 01:37:04,499
I have no idea. He's off-duty.

812
01:37:05,637 --> 01:37:08,523
Check around.

813
01:37:08,624 --> 01:37:10,211
I checked

814
01:37:11,409 --> 01:37:13,473
anywhere a good boy
might go.

815
01:37:14,227 --> 01:37:15,822
You're too late.

816
01:37:18,852 --> 01:37:20,519
It's gone.

817
01:37:23,508 --> 01:37:25,301
He destroyed it.

818
01:37:27,535 --> 01:37:29,692
Everything about it.

819
01:37:30,146 --> 01:37:32,621
Well, except
for the box of bones

820
01:37:32,622 --> 01:37:33,621
that you already took.

821
01:37:37,601 --> 01:37:41,088
Which, I'll wager,
wasn't enough. Here you are.

822
01:37:48,933 --> 01:37:50,826
You tiny thing.

823
01:37:52,482 --> 01:37:55,844
In the face
of the fabulous new,

824
01:37:55,845 --> 01:37:56,844
your only thought
is to kill it?

825
01:37:57,508 --> 01:37:59,938
For fear of great change?

826
01:38:00,977 --> 01:38:03,967
You can't hold the tide
with a broom.

827
01:38:04,461 --> 01:38:06,354
Except that I did.

828
01:38:07,646 --> 01:38:09,340
Where is he?

829
01:38:13,020 --> 01:38:14,814
You're so sure.

830
01:38:16,090 --> 01:38:18,082
Because he told you.

831
01:38:18,495 --> 01:38:20,535
Because we never lie.

832
01:38:22,268 --> 01:38:25,447
I'm gonna tell Mr. Wallace
you tried to shoot me first.

833
01:38:26,304 --> 01:38:28,181
So I had to kill you.

834
01:38:32,828 --> 01:38:34,990
Then do what you gotta do.

835
01:38:36,013 --> 01:38:37,552
Madam.

836
01:39:09,380 --> 01:39:12,557
Location: Officer KD6-3.7.

837
01:44:00,590 --> 01:44:05,952
"Mightn't happen to have

838
01:44:06,462 --> 01:44:07,966
"a piece of cheese
about you, now?"

839
01:44:23,033 --> 01:44:24,603
Would you, boy?

840
01:44:29,966 --> 01:44:31,200
Treasure Island?

841
01:44:31,464 --> 01:44:33,044
He reads.

842
01:44:34,133 --> 01:44:35,662
That's good.

843
01:44:36,621 --> 01:44:38,139
Me, too.

844
01:44:39,146 --> 01:44:42,333
Not much else to do
around here at night anymore.

845
01:44:45,081 --> 01:44:49,519
"Many is the night
I dream of cheese,

846
01:44:53,143 --> 01:44:56,369
"toasted, mostly."

847
01:44:59,712 --> 01:45:01,437
What are you doing here?

848
01:45:04,589 --> 01:45:06,283
I heard the piano.

849
01:45:08,195 --> 01:45:09,790
Don't lie.

850
01:45:10,922 --> 01:45:12,424
It's rude.

851
01:45:14,473 --> 01:45:16,266
You're a cop.

852
01:45:17,430 --> 01:45:20,282
-I'm not here to take you in.
-Oh, yeah?

853
01:45:23,095 --> 01:45:24,616
Then, what?

854
01:45:26,709 --> 01:45:28,901
I just have some questions.

855
01:45:29,473 --> 01:45:31,166
What questions?

856
01:45:48,953 --> 01:45:50,450
Stay.

857
01:48:23,532 --> 01:48:26,646
Look,
I don't wanna hurt you.

858
01:48:26,878 --> 01:48:28,871
But you're not makin' it easy.

859
01:49:01,478 --> 01:49:06,658
â™ھ Like a river flows

860
01:49:06,659 --> 01:49:07,658
â™ھ Surely to the sea

861
01:49:08,611 --> 01:49:12,142
â™ھ Darling, so it goes

862
01:49:12,208 --> 01:49:17,268
â™ھ Some things are meant to be

863
01:49:18,000 --> 01:49:19,794
I like this song.

864
01:49:19,855 --> 01:49:23,662
â™ھ Take my hand

865
01:49:25,454 --> 01:49:30,272
â™ھ Take my whole life, too

866
01:49:30,329 --> 01:49:33,366
We could keep at this,
or we could get a drink.

867
01:49:33,390 --> 01:49:38,463
â™ھ For I can't help

868
01:49:38,885 --> 01:49:45,352
â™ھ Falling in love with you â™ھ

869
01:49:45,963 --> 01:49:47,544
I'll take the drink.

870
01:49:55,922 --> 01:49:57,815
This is really somethin'.

871
01:49:58,060 --> 01:49:59,853
The whole town
was somethin'.

872
01:50:00,302 --> 01:50:01,830
One time.

873
01:50:03,785 --> 01:50:05,778
Forget your troubles,

874
01:50:06,871 --> 01:50:08,764
see a show,

875
01:50:10,384 --> 01:50:12,277
gamble a little.

876
01:50:14,841 --> 01:50:17,331
Win some money,
lose some money.

877
01:50:18,233 --> 01:50:21,522
They made money
seem like candy.

878
01:50:21,900 --> 01:50:23,491
You like whiskey?

879
01:50:24,027 --> 01:50:27,209
I've got millions

880
01:50:27,210 --> 01:50:28,209
of bottles of whiskey.

881
01:50:42,604 --> 01:50:44,097
Here.

882
01:50:44,893 --> 01:50:46,457
Bleeding.

883
01:50:59,126 --> 01:51:00,572
Is it real?

884
01:51:01,216 --> 01:51:02,711
I don't know.

885
01:51:02,863 --> 01:51:04,377
Ask him.

886
01:51:21,023 --> 01:51:22,519
Ya got a name?

887
01:51:24,469 --> 01:51:27,267
Officer KD6-3.7.

888
01:51:27,714 --> 01:51:29,723
That's not a name.
That's a serial number.

889
01:51:31,773 --> 01:51:33,248
All right.

890
01:51:35,755 --> 01:51:37,263
Joe.

891
01:51:37,408 --> 01:51:39,357
What do you want, Joe?

892
01:51:40,531 --> 01:51:43,628
- I wanna ask you some questions.
- Like what?

893
01:51:50,087 --> 01:51:51,930
Like, what was her name?

894
01:51:52,177 --> 01:51:53,938
The mother of your child.

895
01:52:01,067 --> 01:52:02,960
What was she like?

896
01:52:13,597 --> 01:52:15,268
Did you live here together?

897
01:52:15,269 --> 01:52:16,886
Too many questions.

898
01:52:18,155 --> 01:52:20,448
I had your job.
I was good at it.

899
01:52:20,495 --> 01:52:22,982
- It was simpler then.
- Why are you making it complicated?

900
01:52:23,015 --> 01:52:25,574
- Why don't you just answer the question?
- What question?

901
01:52:25,599 --> 01:52:28,487
I didn't figure you,
as one for bullshit.

902
01:52:29,073 --> 01:52:30,867
What's her name?

903
01:52:44,034 --> 01:52:45,470
Rachael.

904
01:52:50,320 --> 01:52:52,313
Her name was Rachael.

905
01:52:56,306 --> 01:52:58,211
What happened to the kid?

906
01:53:01,153 --> 01:53:03,859
Who put it in the orphanage?
Was it you?

907
01:53:06,628 --> 01:53:08,819
I was long gone, by then.

908
01:53:12,301 --> 01:53:14,631
You didn't even meet your own kid?

909
01:53:17,211 --> 01:53:18,685
Why?

910
01:53:19,498 --> 01:53:21,789
Because that was the plan.

911
01:53:23,895 --> 01:53:26,425
I showed them how to
scramble the records,

912
01:53:26,450 --> 01:53:28,121
cover their tracks.

913
01:53:29,100 --> 01:53:31,789
Everyone had a part.
Mine was to leave.

914
01:53:33,245 --> 01:53:35,904
Then the Blackout came,
baked over everything.

915
01:53:35,929 --> 01:53:38,307
Couldn't have found the child,
if I tried.

916
01:53:38,549 --> 01:53:40,132
Did you want to?

917
01:53:40,255 --> 01:53:42,741
- Not really.
- Why not?

918
01:53:42,834 --> 01:53:45,778
Because we were being hunted!

919
01:53:45,943 --> 01:53:48,489
I didn't want our child found.

920
01:53:48,730 --> 01:53:51,755
Taken apart. Dissected!

921
01:53:55,797 --> 01:53:58,641
Sometimes, to love someone...

922
01:54:00,773 --> 01:54:02,668
you gotta be a stranger.

923
01:54:23,905 --> 01:54:25,437
To strangers!

924
01:54:42,765 --> 01:54:46,203
â™ھ It's quarter to three,

925
01:54:46,491 --> 01:54:49,642
â™ھ there's no one in the place

926
01:54:50,236 --> 01:54:52,452
â™ھ except you and me

927
01:54:56,738 --> 01:54:59,321
So, set 'em up, Joe,

928
01:55:00,857 --> 01:55:03,477
â™ھ I got a little story...

929
01:55:05,991 --> 01:55:08,312
â™ھ you oughtta know

930
01:55:11,313 --> 01:55:14,053
â™ھ We're drinkin', my friend,

931
01:55:15,422 --> 01:55:17,209
â™ھ to the end

932
01:55:19,053 --> 01:55:22,121
â™ھ of a brief episode

933
01:55:25,165 --> 01:55:28,366
â™ھ Make it one for my baby

934
01:55:31,473 --> 01:55:33,903
â™ھ and one more for the road.

935
01:56:37,232 --> 01:56:38,761
What'd you do?

936
01:56:39,031 --> 01:56:40,825
Who'd you bring?

937
01:56:42,515 --> 01:56:45,011
- No one.
- Oh, yeah?

938
01:56:50,529 --> 01:56:52,406
Target locked.

939
01:56:54,427 --> 01:56:56,320
They know you're here.

940
01:56:57,544 --> 01:56:59,338
I came alone.

941
01:59:06,109 --> 01:59:07,709
Bad dog!

942
01:59:24,675 --> 01:59:26,206
Stop!

943
01:59:42,271 --> 01:59:44,925
I do hope you're satisfied
with our product.

944
01:59:45,487 --> 01:59:47,011
I love you.

945
02:03:00,740 --> 02:03:02,231
Hey.

946
02:03:02,731 --> 02:03:05,488
There's someone who wants
to meet you.

947
02:03:06,735 --> 02:03:08,429
You can trust us.

948
02:03:16,467 --> 02:03:19,444
You must want me to look up
and to the left.

949
02:03:25,226 --> 02:03:26,920
This is Freysa.

950
02:03:27,415 --> 02:03:29,724
She fought with Sapper on Calantha.

951
02:03:29,749 --> 02:03:31,381
I recognize you.

952
02:03:33,662 --> 02:03:36,034
Did you help him hide the child?

953
02:03:36,190 --> 02:03:37,557
Oh...

954
02:03:37,867 --> 02:03:39,573
I was there.

955
02:03:43,194 --> 02:03:45,386
I saw a miracle delivered.

956
02:03:46,625 --> 02:03:49,912
A perfect little face crying up at me.

957
02:03:50,507 --> 02:03:52,400
Mad as thunder.

958
02:04:05,835 --> 02:04:07,462
Were you with her?...

959
02:04:09,319 --> 02:04:10,802
Rachael?

960
02:04:10,926 --> 02:04:12,919
I held her as she died.

961
02:04:14,518 --> 02:04:16,079
We hid the child,

962
02:04:16,134 --> 02:04:18,868
and made a vow to keep our secret.

963
02:04:19,411 --> 02:04:21,901
That's why Sapper let you kill him.

964
02:04:23,108 --> 02:04:24,676
I knew...

965
02:04:24,808 --> 02:04:29,065
that baby meant we are more
than just slaves.

966
02:04:30,320 --> 02:04:32,910
If a baby can come from one of us,

967
02:04:33,177 --> 02:04:36,195
we are our own masters.

968
02:04:36,522 --> 02:04:38,913
"More human than humans".

969
02:04:41,039 --> 02:04:42,932
A revolution is coming.

970
02:04:43,276 --> 02:04:45,467
And we're building an army.

971
02:04:46,650 --> 02:04:48,842
I want to free our people.

972
02:04:57,294 --> 02:05:00,879
If you want to be free, join us.

973
02:05:06,223 --> 02:05:09,160
Deckard, Sapper, you, me;

974
02:05:09,185 --> 02:05:12,819
our lives mean nothing
next to a storm that's coming.

975
02:05:13,909 --> 02:05:18,299
Dying for the right cause is the
most human thing we can do.

976
02:05:21,254 --> 02:05:23,445
You led to Wallace to Deckard.

977
02:05:24,168 --> 02:05:28,044
You cannot allow Deckard
to lead Wallace to me.

978
02:05:28,631 --> 02:05:30,802
You must kill Deckard.

979
02:05:39,999 --> 02:05:42,888
Deckard only wanted
his baby to be safe.

980
02:05:43,636 --> 02:05:45,430
And she is.

981
02:05:47,331 --> 02:05:48,823
When the time comes,

982
02:05:48,855 --> 02:05:50,908
I will show her to the world.

983
02:05:50,942 --> 02:05:53,031
And se will lead our army.

984
02:05:53,078 --> 02:05:54,564
She?

985
02:05:54,747 --> 02:05:56,441
Of course.

986
02:05:56,815 --> 02:05:58,907
Rachael had a daughter.

987
02:06:00,099 --> 02:06:03,236
With my own eyes, I saw her come.

988
02:06:03,981 --> 02:06:07,157
I dressed her blue when
it was time for her to go.

989
02:06:07,182 --> 02:06:09,473
It was a boy that you hid.

990
02:06:11,300 --> 02:06:14,110
That is just a piece of the puzzle.

991
02:06:31,152 --> 02:06:33,450
You imagined it was you?

992
02:06:35,239 --> 02:06:36,598
Oh.

993
02:06:36,971 --> 02:06:38,489
You did.

994
02:06:39,117 --> 02:06:40,629
You did.

995
02:06:43,286 --> 02:06:45,378
We all wish it was us.

996
02:06:47,047 --> 02:06:48,940
That's why we believe.

997
02:07:05,476 --> 02:07:07,369
Someone lived this, yes.

998
02:07:09,772 --> 02:07:14,352
I showed them how to scramble
the records, cover their tracks.

999
02:07:14,450 --> 02:07:17,338
With my own eyes,
I saw her come.

1000
02:07:18,630 --> 02:07:22,315
I dressed her in blue when
it was time for her to go.

1001
02:07:23,056 --> 02:07:26,160
There's a bit of every
artist in their work.

1002
02:08:03,819 --> 02:08:05,911
Always jumping, that one.

1003
02:08:07,103 --> 02:08:10,263
Never a thought, what to do,
if it made land.

1004
02:08:11,390 --> 02:08:15,971
All the courage in the world
cannot alter fact.

1005
02:08:20,707 --> 02:08:25,885
I have wanted to meet you
for so very long.

1006
02:08:44,329 --> 02:08:46,918
You are a wonder to me,
Mr Deckard.

1007
02:08:52,827 --> 02:08:54,492
I had the lock.

1008
02:08:56,227 --> 02:08:58,418
I found the key.

1009
02:08:59,703 --> 02:09:04,206
Yet the pins do not align,
the door remains locked.

1010
02:09:06,922 --> 02:09:10,308
I need a specimen to reach it, Mr Deckard.

1011
02:09:14,089 --> 02:09:15,564
The child.

1012
02:09:16,975 --> 02:09:18,868
I need the child.

1013
02:09:20,061 --> 02:09:22,534
To teach them all to fly.

1014
02:09:30,986 --> 02:09:34,869
"And God remembered Rachel,

1015
02:09:36,882 --> 02:09:38,536
"He heeded her

1016
02:09:39,470 --> 02:09:41,363
"and opened her womb."

1017
02:09:42,080 --> 02:09:43,932
Do you like our owl?

1018
02:09:46,529 --> 02:09:48,376
It's artificial?

1019
02:09:49,324 --> 02:09:51,060
Of course it is.

1020
02:09:52,708 --> 02:09:54,521
Must be expensive.

1021
02:09:56,187 --> 02:09:57,640
Very.

1022
02:09:57,691 --> 02:09:59,385
I'm Rachael.

1023
02:09:59,874 --> 02:10:01,369
Deckard.

1024
02:10:13,326 --> 02:10:14,920
Is it the same,...

1025
02:10:16,397 --> 02:10:18,641
now as then,...

1026
02:10:21,473 --> 02:10:23,664
the moment you met her?

1027
02:10:33,417 --> 02:10:36,709
All these years you
looked back on that day,

1028
02:10:36,734 --> 02:10:39,780
drunk on the memory
of its perfection.

1029
02:10:43,071 --> 02:10:45,362
How shiny, her lips!

1030
02:10:45,467 --> 02:10:48,167
How instant, your connection!

1031
02:10:51,157 --> 02:10:52,893
Did it never occur to you,

1032
02:10:52,918 --> 02:10:56,142
that's why you were summoned
in the first place?

1033
02:10:57,592 --> 02:11:00,514
Designed to do nothing short of,
fall for her,

1034
02:11:00,539 --> 02:11:03,139
right then and there.

1035
02:11:05,409 --> 02:11:07,862
All to make that single,

1036
02:11:07,902 --> 02:11:09,393
perfect...

1037
02:11:09,440 --> 02:11:10,981
specimen.

1038
02:11:14,003 --> 02:11:16,792
That is, if you were designed.

1039
02:11:18,353 --> 02:11:19,861
Love,

1040
02:11:20,116 --> 02:11:22,904
or mathematical precision.

1041
02:11:28,530 --> 02:11:30,006
Yes?

1042
02:11:30,796 --> 02:11:32,303
No?

1043
02:11:36,787 --> 02:11:38,879
I know what's real.

1044
02:12:02,890 --> 02:12:06,273
It was very clever to keep
yourself empty of information.

1045
02:12:06,298 --> 02:12:09,883
And all it cost you was, everything.

1046
02:12:14,044 --> 02:12:16,335
But you can still help me.

1047
02:12:17,627 --> 02:12:20,814
You help help in the hiding.

1048
02:12:23,286 --> 02:12:25,159
Where did they go?

1049
02:12:26,877 --> 02:12:28,969
I know, you know something.

1050
02:12:30,017 --> 02:12:31,465
Help me...

1051
02:12:32,392 --> 02:12:35,944
and very, very good things
can come to you.

1052
02:12:41,615 --> 02:12:43,409
You don't have children.

1053
02:12:47,112 --> 02:12:48,508
Do you?

1054
02:12:48,981 --> 02:12:51,371
Oh, I have millions.

1055
02:12:53,759 --> 02:12:56,945
You think I have nothing to offer
but pain?

1056
02:12:57,241 --> 02:12:58,935
Only, I know...

1057
02:13:00,328 --> 02:13:01,922
you love pain.

1058
02:13:03,313 --> 02:13:07,750
Pain reminds you,
the joy you felt was real.

1059
02:13:09,774 --> 02:13:11,482
More joy, then!

1060
02:13:17,845 --> 02:13:19,837
Do not be afraid.

1061
02:13:34,673 --> 02:13:36,267
An angel...

1062
02:13:37,493 --> 02:13:39,386
made again.

1063
02:13:43,104 --> 02:13:44,631
For you.

1064
02:14:18,779 --> 02:14:20,495
Did you miss me?

1065
02:14:38,564 --> 02:14:40,325
Don't you love me?

1066
02:14:59,269 --> 02:15:00,968
Her eyes were green.

1067
02:15:18,480 --> 02:15:20,250
Off-world,...

1068
02:15:20,882 --> 02:15:23,870
I have everything I need
to make you talk.

1069
02:15:26,044 --> 02:15:28,435
You do not know what pain is, yet.

1070
02:15:30,324 --> 02:15:32,001
You will learn.

1071
02:15:43,959 --> 02:15:45,852
Hello handsome.

1072
02:16:02,671 --> 02:16:05,261
What day, hm?

1073
02:16:08,948 --> 02:16:10,841
You look lonely.

1074
02:16:11,928 --> 02:16:13,821
I can fix that.

1075
02:16:17,312 --> 02:16:20,137
You look like a good Joe.

1076
02:16:55,345 --> 02:17:00,663
Dying for the right cause is the
most human thing we can do.

1077
02:17:03,686 --> 02:17:06,077
Because you've
nevert seen a miracle.

1078
02:17:44,493 --> 02:17:47,865
You are entering Los Angeles Airport,
restricted airspace

1079
02:17:47,904 --> 02:17:49,424
Confirm your identity.

1080
02:17:49,449 --> 02:17:53,034
Transport S-14 Branch D, confirmed.

1081
02:17:53,416 --> 02:17:55,994
Base, this is 06 outbound...

1082
02:17:58,230 --> 02:17:59,924
Where are we going?

1083
02:18:00,917 --> 02:18:02,412
Home.

1084
02:18:57,439 --> 02:19:01,370
Drive 2 down.
Backup engaged.

1085
02:19:01,922 --> 02:19:03,369
Warning.

1086
02:19:03,394 --> 02:19:05,984
- Can we make it?
- We're too low!

1087
02:19:06,528 --> 02:19:08,112
Take us back!

1088
02:19:57,117 --> 02:19:58,686
Get us up!

1089
02:20:22,980 --> 02:20:24,559
Open the door.

1090
02:22:17,123 --> 02:22:18,855
I am the best one.

1091
02:22:59,772 --> 02:23:01,651
Off-world is waiting.

1092
02:25:14,848 --> 02:25:17,307
Joe. Joe!

1093
02:25:27,484 --> 02:25:29,001
Joe!

1094
02:26:08,131 --> 02:26:10,391
You should've let me die out there.

1095
02:26:11,362 --> 02:26:12,930
You did.

1096
02:26:16,690 --> 02:26:18,518
You drowned out there.

1097
02:26:24,239 --> 02:26:27,056
You're free to meet your daughter, now.

1098
02:27:51,585 --> 02:27:54,076
All the best memories are hers.

1099
02:28:03,200 --> 02:28:04,720
Why?

1100
02:28:07,273 --> 02:28:09,032
Who am I to you?

1101
02:28:18,227 --> 02:28:20,009
Go meet your daughter.

1102
02:28:26,169 --> 02:28:27,863
You OK?

1103
02:31:03,843 --> 02:31:05,445
Just a moment.

1104
02:31:07,924 --> 02:31:09,941
Beautiful, isn't it?
