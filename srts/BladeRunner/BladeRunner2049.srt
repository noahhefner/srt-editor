1
0:4:56,775 --> 0:5:0,295
I hope you don't mind me
taking the liberty.

2
0:5:2,655 --> 0:5:4,912
I was careful
not to drag in any dirt.

3
0:5:5,61 --> 0:5:7,371
I don't mind the dirt.

4
0:5:8,88 --> 0:5:10,356
I do mind

5
0:5:11,819 --> 0:5:13,995
unannounced visits.

6
0:5:14,535 --> 0:5:17,175
You police?

7
0:5:19,704 --> 0:5:21,568
Are you Sapper Morton?
Civic number NK68514?

8
0:5:22,811 --> 0:5:27,550
I'm a farmer.

9
0:5:27,616 --> 0:5:29,546
I saw that.

10
0:5:29,790 --> 0:5:31,327
What do you farm?

11
0:5:31,855 --> 0:5:33,796
It's a protein farm.

12
0:5:40,821 --> 0:5:42,838
Wallace design.

13
0:5:43,311 --> 0:5:45,408
Is that what I smell?

14
0:5:46,956 --> 0:5:48,650
Grow that just for me.

15
0:5:49,202 --> 0:5:51,108
Garlic.

16
0:5:52,41 --> 0:5:53,731
Garlic.

17
0:5:53,732 --> 0:11:39,463
Go on, try some.

18
0:5:55,240 --> 0:5:57,133
No, thank you.

19
0:5:57,935 --> 0:5:59,629
I prefer to keep
an empty stomach

20
0:6:1,417 --> 0:6:5,795
until the hard part
of the day is done.

21
0:6:8,323 --> 0:6:10,52
How long you been here?

22
0:6:10,77 --> 0:6:11,714
Since 2020.

23
0:6:12,974 --> 0:6:15,814
But you haven't always
been a farmer, have you?

24
0:6:17,432 --> 0:6:19,46
Your bag.

25
0:6:19,242 --> 0:6:21,431
It's colonial medical use.

26
0:6:21,542 --> 0:6:23,258
Military issue.

27
0:6:25,629 --> 0:6:28,480
Where were you? Calantha?

28
0:6:32,860 --> 0:6:34,591
Must have been brutal.

29
0:6:35,52 --> 0:6:37,280
Plan on taking me in?

30
0:6:39,970 --> 0:6:41,911
Let them take a look inside?

31
0:6:42,162 --> 0:6:43,657
Mr. Morton,

32
0:6:44,610 --> 0:6:47,100
if taking you in
is an option,

33
0:6:51,257 --> 0:6:54,146
I would much prefer that
to the alternative.

34
0:6:55,363 --> 0:6:58,584
I'm sure you knew
it would be someone in time.

35
0:7:0,317 --> 0:7:2,399
I'm sorry it had to be me.

36
0:7:6,35 --> 0:7:7,946
Good as any.

37
0:7:12,689 --> 0:7:14,681
Now, if you don't mind,

38
0:7:15,270 --> 0:7:18,361
if you could just look up
and to the left, please.

39
0:8:15,7 --> 0:8:17,95
Please don't get up.

40
0:8:27,942 --> 0:8:31,210
How's it feel
killing your own kind?

41
0:8:34,869 --> 0:8:38,376
I don't retire my own kind
because we don't run.

42
0:8:40,380 --> 0:8:42,221
Only older models do.

43
0:8:42,246 --> 0:8:46,737
And you new models
are happy scraping the shit

44
0:8:51,225 --> 0:8:53,909
because you've never
seen a miracle.

45
0:9:35,15 --> 0:9:37,107
Just photograph everything.

46
0:9:48,744 --> 0:9:50,637
Madam, please.

47
0:9:50,848 --> 0:9:53,713
Incoming LAPD re-codec hash.

48
0:9:56,651 --> 0:9:59,639
You're hurt.
I'm not payin' for that.

49
0:10:0,434 --> 0:10:2,625
-I'll glue it.
-And?

50
0:10:8,642 --> 0:10:10,582
One of the tail-end Nexus 8s.

51
0:10:10,613 --> 0:10:13,481
He looks like he could
take your head off.

52
0:10:13,482 --> 0:10:14,481
He tried.

53
0:10:14,506 --> 0:10:16,645
He went AWOL after Calantha

54
0:10:16,704 --> 0:10:20,82
with a few more in his outfit
I wouldn't mind closin' out.

55
0:10:20,310 --> 0:10:22,601
-Just him?
-Just him.

56
0:10:23,167 --> 0:10:25,508
Come on home
for your baseline.

57
0:10:29,193 --> 0:10:30,999
One moment, madam.

58
0:11:18,594 --> 0:11:21,84
30 meters to maximum depth.

59
0:11:36,665 --> 0:11:38,244
What is that?

60
0:11:43,456 --> 0:11:45,441
I'll send a dig team.

61
0:11:46,313 --> 0:11:48,262
Come on home before the storm.

62
0:13:5,764 --> 0:13:9,445
Officer KD6-3.7.

63
0:13:9,470 --> 0:13:11,562
-Let's begin. Ready?
- Yes, sir.

64
0:13:12,731 --> 0:13:14,364
Recite your baseline.

65
0:13:14,389 --> 0:13:17,576
And blood-black
nothingness began to spin

66
0:13:19,269 --> 0:13:21,926
A system of cells
interlinked within cells

67
0:13:21,951 --> 0:13:24,247
interlinked within cells

68
0:13:24,248 --> 0:13:25,247
interlinked within one stem.

69
0:13:25,272 --> 0:13:27,77
Fuck off, skin-job.

70
0:13:28,750 --> 0:13:32,501
And dreadfully distinct
Against the dark,

71
0:13:32,502 --> 0:13:33,501
a tall white fountain played.

72
0:13:34,664 --> 0:13:35,957
- Cells.
- Cells.

73
0:13:35,982 --> 0:13:37,889
Have you ever been
in an institution?

74
0:13:37,914 --> 0:13:39,206
-Cells.
- Cells.

75
0:13:39,207 --> 0:13:40,500
Do they
keep you in a cell?

76
0:13:40,501 --> 0:13:41,794
-Cells.
- Cells.

77
0:13:41,795 --> 0:13:43,681
When you're not
performing your duties,

78
0:13:43,682 --> 0:13:44,681
do they keep you
in a little box?

79
0:13:44,682 --> 0:13:45,775
-Cells.
- Cells.

80
0:13:45,776 --> 0:13:47,667
- Interlinked.
- Interlinked.

81
0:13:47,668 --> 0:13:49,508
What's it like to hold
the hand of someone you love?

82
0:13:49,509 --> 0:13:51,1
-Interlinked.
- Interlinked.

83
0:13:51,2 --> 0:13:52,842
Did they teach you
how to feel finger to finger?

84
0:13:52,843 --> 0:13:54,236
-Interlinked.
- Interlinked.

85
0:13:54,237 --> 0:13:55,928
Do you long for having
your heart interlinked?

86
0:13:55,929 --> 0:13:57,321
-Interlinked.
- Interlinked.

87
0:13:57,322 --> 0:13:59,113
Do you dream
about being interlinked?

88
0:13:59,114 --> 0:13:59,909
Interlinked.

89
0:13:59,910 --> 0:14:1,700
What's it like to hold
your child in your arms?

90
0:14:1,701 --> 0:14:2,945
-Interlinked.
- Interlinked.

91
0:14:2,946 --> 0:14:4,686
Do you feel that there's
a part of you that's missing?

92
0:14:4,687 --> 0:14:5,881
-Interlinked.
- Interlinked.

93
0:14:5,882 --> 0:14:8,568
- Within cells interlinked.
- Within cells interlinked.

94
0:14:8,569 --> 0:14:10,1
Why don't you
say that three times.

95
0:14:10,2 --> 0:14:11,1
Within cells interlinked.

96
0:14:11,28 --> 0:14:14,103
Within cells interlinked.

97
0:14:14,128 --> 0:14:16,110
Within cells interlinked.
Within cells interlinked.

98
0:14:19,65 --> 0:14:20,660
We're done.

99
0:14:21,944 --> 0:14:23,638
Constant "K."

100
0:14:24,141 --> 0:14:26,182
You can pick up your bonus.

101
0:14:27,318 --> 0:14:28,925
Thank you, sir.

102
0:14:28,987 --> 0:14:30,962
Caution, keep clear.

103
0:14:32,77 --> 0:14:34,143
Caution, keep clear.

104
0:14:37,135 --> 0:14:39,817
Connect to off-world

105
0:14:39,818 --> 0:14:40,817
any time, any place.

106
0:14:40,818 --> 0:14:43,305
Packages start at 20 minutes.

107
0:14:43,306 --> 0:14:45,100
Many options available.

108
0:14:49,838 --> 0:14:53,124
Joi goes anywhere
you want her to go.

109
0:14:53,620 --> 0:14:57,655
Connect to
off-world any time, any place.

110
0:15:41,36 --> 0:15:44,554
"K"? I didn't hear you.
You're early.

111
0:15:44,619 --> 0:15:46,611
You want me to come back?

112
0:15:46,839 --> 0:15:49,137
Just go scrub.

113
0:15:51,29 --> 0:15:52,761
Yes, ma'am.

114
0:15:54,468 --> 0:15:56,262
How was your meeting?

115
0:15:56,616 --> 0:15:58,641
The usual.

116
0:15:59,750 --> 0:16:1,743
How was your day?

117
0:16:2,498 --> 0:16:5,691
I'm getting cabin fever.

118
0:16:9,289 --> 0:16:11,580
99.9% detoxified water.

119
0:16:12,131 --> 0:16:14,123
I had an accident at work.
I think I ruined my shirt.

120
0:16:14,556 --> 0:16:16,526
I'm sure
I can fix that for you.

121
0:16:16,551 --> 0:16:18,556
Let me take a look at it.

122
0:16:24,458 --> 0:16:26,152
I need a drink.

123
0:16:27,37 --> 0:16:29,725
Do you want a drink first?

124
0:16:29,726 --> 0:16:30,725
Mmm-hmm.
Pour me one, will ya?

125
0:16:32,434 --> 0:16:34,28
I'm trying a new recipe.

126
0:16:34,138 --> 0:16:36,140
I just need
a bit more practice.

127
0:16:36,165 --> 0:16:37,794
Don't fuss.

128
0:16:40,308 --> 0:16:42,573
I should have
marinated it longer.

129
0:16:42,695 --> 0:16:44,503
I hope it isn't dry.

130
0:16:46,616 --> 0:16:50,306
Did you know
this song was released

131
0:16:50,307 --> 0:16:51,306
in 1966 on Reprise Records?

132
0:16:51,923 --> 0:16:54,154
It was number one
on the charts.

133
0:16:59,242 --> 0:17:0,826
It won't be much longer.

134
0:17:0,851 --> 0:17:3,422
Just putting on
the finishing touches.

135
0:17:7,277 --> 0:17:11,155
Okay, it's ready.
I hope you're gonna like it.

136
0:17:11,180 --> 0:17:13,138
I told you not to fuss.

137
0:17:14,942 --> 0:17:16,761
And yet...

138
0:17:19,346 --> 0:17:22,75
Voilأ ! Bon appأ©tit.

139
0:17:24,734 --> 0:17:26,786
I missed you, baby sweet.

140
0:17:28,631 --> 0:17:30,623
Honey, it's beautiful.

141
0:17:30,852 --> 0:17:32,716
Just put your feet up.

142
0:17:33,389 --> 0:17:35,182
Relax.

143
0:17:53,213 --> 0:17:55,205
Was a day, hmm?

144
0:17:56,418 --> 0:17:58,199
It was a day.

145
0:17:59,14 --> 0:18:0,976
Would you read to me?

146
0:18:2,312 --> 0:18:3,866
It'll make you feel better.

147
0:18:3,935 --> 0:18:7,365
-You hate that book.
-I don't wanna read either.

148
0:18:9,93 --> 0:18:10,420
Let's dance.

149
0:18:10,445 --> 0:18:13,1
Do you wanna dance, or do you
wanna open your present?

150
0:18:13,41 --> 0:18:14,636
What present?

151
0:18:18,457 --> 0:18:19,965
This one.

152
0:18:20,63 --> 0:18:21,715
What's the occasion?

153
0:18:21,846 --> 0:18:23,738
Let's just say

154
0:18:24,71 --> 0:18:27,345
-it's our anniversary.
-Is it?

155
0:18:28,352 --> 0:18:32,930
No, but let's just
say that it is.

156
0:18:33,559 --> 0:18:34,954
Okay?

157
0:18:38,496 --> 0:18:40,223
Happy anniversary.

158
0:18:41,299 --> 0:18:43,92
An emanator.

159
0:19:25,573 --> 0:19:27,9
Thank you.

160
0:19:27,49 --> 0:19:31,132
Honey, you can go anywhere
you want in the world now.

161
0:19:32,241 --> 0:19:34,358
Where do you wanna go first?

162
0:21:48,212 --> 0:21:50,715
I'm so happy
when I'm with you.

163
0:21:52,843 --> 0:21:55,11
You don't have to say that.

164
0:22:26,158 --> 0:22:28,939
The dig's come through.
We have a new lead.

165
0:22:29,636 --> 0:22:31,276
Get down here.

166
0:22:44,773 --> 0:22:48,946
Carbon read: 14.6 GPH.

167
0:23:8,833 --> 0:23:12,276
Your box
is a military footlocker

168
0:23:12,277 --> 0:23:13,276
issued to Sapper Morton,

169
0:23:13,611 --> 0:23:16,468
creatively repurposed
as an ossuary:

170
0:23:16,539 --> 0:23:18,156
a box of bones.

171
0:23:18,567 --> 0:23:20,559
Nothin' else in it but hair.

172
0:23:21,705 --> 0:23:24,986
The soil samples indicate that

173
0:23:24,987 --> 0:23:25,986
she's been buried
for 30 years.

174
0:23:26,551 --> 0:23:29,829
Bones all dismantled,
fully cleaned,

175
0:23:29,830 --> 0:23:30,829
meticulously laid to rest.

176
0:23:30,891 --> 0:23:32,486
"She"?

177
0:23:33,751 --> 0:23:35,668
Cause of death, Coco?

178
0:23:46,219 --> 0:23:49,843
No breaks,
no sign of trauma, except

179
0:23:50,627 --> 0:23:53,118
a fracture
through the ilium.

180
0:23:53,839 --> 0:23:56,784
It's a narrow birth canal.
Baby must have got stuck.

181
0:23:56,840 --> 0:23:59,753
- She was pregnant?
- Hmm.

182
0:24:0,18 --> 0:24:2,710
So he didn't kill her?

183
0:24:2,711 --> 0:24:3,710
Mmm. She died in childbirth.

184
0:24:5,522 --> 0:24:7,48
What's that?

185
0:24:8,102 --> 0:24:9,642
Go back.

186
0:24:10,407 --> 0:24:11,931
Closer.

187
0:24:13,264 --> 0:24:14,858
Closer.

188
0:24:17,568 --> 0:24:19,222
What's that?

189
0:24:20,804 --> 0:24:22,197
Huh.

190
0:24:22,291 --> 0:24:25,708
Notching in the iliac crest.

191
0:24:26,237 --> 0:24:29,540
It's fine-point,
like a scalpel.

192
0:24:30,546 --> 0:24:33,197
That looks like
an emergency C-section.

193
0:24:33,663 --> 0:24:37,148
The cuts are clean.
No sign of a struggle.

194
0:24:37,918 --> 0:24:39,741
He was a combat medic.

195
0:24:40,473 --> 0:24:42,770
Maybe he tried to save her
and he just couldn't.

196
0:24:42,809 --> 0:24:44,858
He didn't seem like
the saving type.

197
0:24:44,883 --> 0:24:47,317
He went to the trouble
of burying her.

198
0:24:47,525 --> 0:24:49,666
A sentimental skin-job.

199
0:24:51,622 --> 0:24:53,56
Sorry.

200
0:24:53,467 --> 0:24:55,339
So where's the kid?

201
0:24:56,728 --> 0:24:58,610
You scan the whole field?

202
0:24:58,649 --> 0:25:0,266
Just dirt and worms.

203
0:25:0,267 --> 0:25:1,266
No other bodies.

204
0:25:1,291 --> 0:25:2,922
Maybe he ate it.

205
0:25:51,788 --> 0:25:53,737
That's not possible.

206
0:25:56,206 --> 0:25:58,99
She was a Replicant.

207
0:26:0,662 --> 0:26:2,324
Pregnant.

208
0:26:11,285 --> 0:26:15,361
The world is built on a wall.

209
0:26:15,362 --> 0:26:16,361
It separates kind.

210
0:26:17,488 --> 0:26:20,73
Tell either side
there's no wall,

211
0:26:20,74 --> 0:26:21,73
you bought a war.

212
0:26:21,703 --> 0:26:23,370
Or a slaughter.

213
0:26:27,96 --> 0:26:29,89
So, what you saw

214
0:26:31,85 --> 0:26:32,937
didn't happen.

215
0:26:34,668 --> 0:26:36,136
Yes, madam.

216
0:26:36,161 --> 0:26:39,46
It is my job to keep order.

217
0:26:39,162 --> 0:26:42,51
That's what we do here.
We keep order.

218
0:26:43,925 --> 0:26:45,619
You want it gone?

219
0:26:47,86 --> 0:26:48,777
Erase everything.

220
0:26:48,826 --> 0:26:50,644
Even the child?

221
0:26:50,645 --> 0:26:51,644
All trace.

222
0:26:55,878 --> 0:26:58,47
You have anything more to say?

223
0:26:59,713 --> 0:27:2,773
I've never retired something
that was born before.

224
0:27:3,764 --> 0:27:5,652
What's the difference?

225
0:27:9,567 --> 0:27:12,57
To be born is to have a soul,
I guess.

226
0:27:13,134 --> 0:27:15,27
Are you telling me no?

227
0:27:16,7 --> 0:27:18,558
I wasn't aware
that was an option, madam.

228
0:27:18,594 --> 0:27:20,230
Attaboy.

229
0:27:23,296 --> 0:27:24,692
Hey.

230
0:27:24,873 --> 0:27:27,64
You've been getting on fine
without one.

231
0:27:27,455 --> 0:27:29,10
What's that, madam?

232
0:27:29,260 --> 0:27:30,852
A soul.

233
0:28:17,584 --> 0:28:22,562
And you new models
are happy scraping the shit

234
0:28:24,673 --> 0:28:27,219
because you've never seen
a miracle.

235
0:28:51,222 --> 0:28:53,789
Just checking in
on an old serial number.

236
0:28:58,679 --> 0:29:0,572
Confirmation DNA?

237
0:29:1,494 --> 0:29:3,268
I got hair.

238
0:29:20,291 --> 0:29:23,732
Oh! An old one.

239
0:29:24,395 --> 0:29:26,264
Pre-Blackout. Huh.

240
0:29:27,444 --> 0:29:29,636
That's gonna be tough.

241
0:29:30,597 --> 0:29:33,83
Not much from then.

242
0:29:33,84 --> 0:29:34,83
And what's there is

243
0:29:34,738 --> 0:29:36,532
thick milky.

244
0:29:37,412 --> 0:29:40,297
You can customize them
as much as you'd like.

245
0:29:40,673 --> 0:29:43,63
As human
as you want them to be.

246
0:29:43,554 --> 0:29:46,851
But your operation is strictly
a drill site, isn't it?

247
0:29:47,166 --> 0:29:50,548
I wouldn't waste your money
on intelligence,

248
0:29:50,549 --> 0:29:51,548
attachment or appeal.

249
0:29:52,257 --> 0:29:55,974
Unless you'd like to add some
pleasure models to your order.

250
0:30:9,296 --> 0:30:12,473
Would it be possible to
reschedule this call, please?

251
0:30:14,935 --> 0:30:17,388
Everyone remembers

252
0:30:17,389 --> 0:30:18,388
where they were
at the Blackout. You?

253
0:30:18,420 --> 0:30:20,772
That was a little
before my time.

254
0:30:20,828 --> 0:30:23,310
Mmm. I was home with my folks,

255
0:30:23,444 --> 0:30:26,114
then ten days of darkness.
Every machine stopped cold.

256
0:30:26,139 --> 0:30:28,656
When the lights came back,
we were wiped clean.

257
0:30:28,681 --> 0:30:32,517
Photos, files, every bit of
data... Ffft! Gone.

258
0:30:32,550 --> 0:30:34,535
Bank records, too.

259
0:30:34,536 --> 0:30:35,535
Didn't mind that.

260
0:30:35,638 --> 0:30:37,727
It's funny it's only paper
that lasted.

261
0:30:37,751 --> 0:30:40,618
I mean, we had
everything on drives.

262
0:30:40,619 --> 0:30:41,617
Everything, everything,
everything! Huh.

263
0:30:43,3 --> 0:30:46,91
My mom still cries
over the lost baby pictures.

264
0:30:46,227 --> 0:30:48,526
Well, it's a shame. You

265
0:30:48,527 --> 0:30:49,526
-must have been adorable.
-Hmm... Ah.

266
0:30:49,613 --> 0:30:51,644
Uh...

267
0:30:55,774 --> 0:30:58,563
Pretty fractured.
Not much on it.

268
0:30:59,526 --> 0:31:2,66
One of the last gens,
pre-Prohibition.

269
0:31:2,313 --> 0:31:5,566
Standard issue.
Made by Tyrell.

270
0:31:6,210 --> 0:31:7,745
And?

271
0:31:7,986 --> 0:31:10,74
Unremarkable.

272
0:31:10,75 --> 0:31:11,74
"Unremarkable"?

273
0:31:11,247 --> 0:31:14,187
There must be something
else we can find for him.

274
0:31:21,552 --> 0:31:24,142
Another prodigal
serial number returns.

275
0:31:25,673 --> 0:31:28,561
A 30-year-old open case
finally closed.

276
0:31:29,110 --> 0:31:30,949
Thank you, officer.

277
0:31:31,874 --> 0:31:34,289
I'm here for Mr. Wallace.
I'm Luv.

278
0:31:36,445 --> 0:31:38,180
He named you.

279
0:31:38,820 --> 0:31:40,656
Must be special.

280
0:31:41,246 --> 0:31:43,172
I'm here for Mr. Wallace.

281
0:31:43,173 --> 0:31:44,172
Follow me.

282
0:31:50,586 --> 0:31:54,72
The ancient models
give the entire endeavor
a bad name.

283
0:31:55,364 --> 0:32:0,44
What a gift, don't you think,
from Mr. Wallace to the world?

284
0:32:3,153 --> 0:32:5,908
The outer colonies
would never have flourished

285
0:32:5,909 --> 0:32:6,908
had he not bought Tyrell,

286
0:32:6,956 --> 0:32:9,48
revivified the technology.

287
0:32:9,895 --> 0:32:11,987
To say the least
of what we do.

288
0:32:15,317 --> 0:32:17,364
I see you're also a customer.

289
0:32:17,683 --> 0:32:20,200
Are you satisfied
with our product?

290
0:32:20,390 --> 0:32:24,74
She's very realistic.
Thank you.

291
0:32:24,900 --> 0:32:27,358
Here. All the junk is in here.

292
0:32:27,679 --> 0:32:30,568
Lucky for you,
Mr. Wallace is a data hoarder.

293
0:32:43,77 --> 0:32:45,316
No one's been
down here in ages.

294
0:32:48,255 --> 0:32:50,81
Sorry about that.

295
0:33:1,422 --> 0:33:5,55
All our memory bearings
from the time.

296
0:33:5,56 --> 0:33:6,55
They were all damaged
in the Blackout.

297
0:33:6,404 --> 0:33:8,899
But there are
sometimes fragments.

298
0:33:24,692 --> 0:33:26,226
You got a little boy.

299
0:33:26,218 --> 0:33:27,943
He shows you
his butterfly collection,

300
0:33:27,944 --> 0:33:28,943
plus the killing jar.

301
0:33:28,975 --> 0:33:30,911
I'd take him
to the doctor.

302
0:33:33,318 --> 0:33:35,690
There's a wasp
crawling on your arm.

303
0:33:35,691 --> 0:33:36,690
I'd kill it.

304
0:33:38,726 --> 0:33:41,828
You're reading a magazine.

305
0:33:41,829 --> 0:33:42,828
You come across a full-page
nude photo of a girl.

306
0:33:42,859 --> 0:33:45,21
Is this testing
whether I'm a Replicant

307
0:33:45,22 --> 0:33:46,21
or a lesbian, Mr. Deckard?

308
0:33:46,46 --> 0:33:48,365
Just answer
the questions, please.

309
0:33:51,870 --> 0:33:55,552
It was unclear what she was,
at least to someone.

310
0:33:55,700 --> 0:33:57,309
This was a test.

311
0:33:57,897 --> 0:34:0,89
We were difficult
to spot then.

312
0:34:1,794 --> 0:34:5,33
Was there anything unusual
about how you found her?

313
0:34:5,183 --> 0:34:7,800
To warrant an official
investigation?

314
0:34:10,232 --> 0:34:13,372
You know how people are
about old serial numbers.

315
0:34:13,883 --> 0:34:16,496
Everyone just sleeps better

316
0:34:16,497 --> 0:34:17,496
when they know
where they got to.

317
0:34:20,252 --> 0:34:21,827
She likes him.

318
0:34:23,61 --> 0:34:24,569
Who?

319
0:34:24,730 --> 0:34:27,121
This Officer Deckard.

320
0:34:28,314 --> 0:34:30,319
She's trying to provoke him.

321
0:34:33,711 --> 0:34:37,97
It is invigorating being asked
personal questions.

322
0:34:37,394 --> 0:34:39,88
Makes one feel

323
0:34:40,319 --> 0:34:42,259
desired.

324
0:34:43,82 --> 0:34:45,289
Do you enjoy
your work, officer?

325
0:34:49,691 --> 0:34:52,114
Please thank Mr. Wallace
for your time.

326
0:35:4,384 --> 0:35:7,69
You worked
with Officer Deckard

327
0:35:7,70 --> 0:35:8,69
back in the day.

328
0:35:8,823 --> 0:35:10,891
What can you tell me
about him?

329
0:35:11,387 --> 0:35:13,579
He liked to work alone.

330
0:35:14,565 --> 0:35:16,410
So did I.

331
0:35:18,371 --> 0:35:21,558
So we worked together
to keep it that way.

332
0:35:22,806 --> 0:35:24,409
That was it.

333
0:35:25,394 --> 0:35:27,713
Anything else
you can tell me?

334
0:35:29,330 --> 0:35:31,681
He wasn't long for this world.

335
0:35:33,931 --> 0:35:35,545
How so?

336
0:35:37,674 --> 0:35:40,65
Something in his eyes.

337
0:35:43,163 --> 0:35:45,653
Any idea how I could
contact him?

338
0:35:45,949 --> 0:35:47,473
None.

339
0:35:48,836 --> 0:35:51,127
He's nyugdأ­jas.

340
0:35:54,220 --> 0:35:55,743
Retired.

341
0:35:57,95 --> 0:35:58,627
What happened?

342
0:35:58,652 --> 0:36:1,142
Probably got what he wanted.

343
0:36:3,376 --> 0:36:5,169
To be alone.

344
0:36:30,12 --> 0:36:32,5
Welcome back, sir.

345
0:36:33,342 --> 0:36:36,133
You wanted to review
the new model, sir,

346
0:36:36,134 --> 0:36:37,133
before shipment?

347
0:36:38,57 --> 0:36:41,465
An angel
should never enter

348
0:36:41,466 --> 0:36:42,465
the kingdom of heaven

349
0:36:42,950 --> 0:36:44,817
without a gift.

350
0:36:47,62 --> 0:36:50,548
Can you at least pronounce,
"A child is born"?

351
0:36:53,82 --> 0:36:54,707
Hmm.

352
0:37:1,466 --> 0:37:3,269
A new model.

353
0:37:10,761 --> 0:37:13,151
Well, let us see her, then.

354
0:38:1,564 --> 0:38:4,213
The first thought

355
0:38:6,798 --> 0:38:8,791
one tends to fear,

356
0:38:10,32 --> 0:38:12,24
to preserve the clay.

357
0:38:14,625 --> 0:38:16,518
It's fascinating.

358
0:38:17,544 --> 0:38:20,287
Before we even know
what we are,

359
0:38:22,562 --> 0:38:24,287
we fear to lose it.

360
0:38:25,950 --> 0:38:27,691
Happy birthday.

361
0:38:37,129 --> 0:38:38,615
Now, let's have a look at you.

362
0:39:30,615 --> 0:39:33,119
We make angels

363
0:39:34,119 --> 0:39:38,323
in the service
of civilization.

364
0:39:38,323 --> 0:39:41,593
Yes, there were
bad angels once.

365
0:39:41,593 --> 0:39:43,996
I make good angels now.

366
0:39:29,943 --> 0:39:34,140
That is how I took us
to nine new worlds.

367
0:39:37,206 --> 0:39:38,701
Nine.

368
0:39:40,260 --> 0:39:43,815
A child can count to nine
on fingers.

369
0:39:43,844 --> 0:39:46,682
We should own the stars.

370
0:39:46,714 --> 0:39:48,291
Yes, sir.

371
0:39:51,133 --> 0:39:53,581
Every leap
of civilization

372
0:39:53,606 --> 0:39:56,262
was built off the back
of a disposable workforce.

373
0:39:56,293 --> 0:39:59,299
We lost our stomach
for slaves

374
0:39:59,535 --> 0:40:1,610
unless engineered.

375
0:40:4,768 --> 0:40:7,59
But I can only make so many.

376
0:40:12,763 --> 0:40:15,154
That barren pasture,

377
0:40:15,879 --> 0:40:18,129
empty

378
0:40:18,130 --> 0:40:19,129
and salted...

379
0:40:21,86 --> 0:40:22,580
...right here.

380
0:40:24,677 --> 0:40:28,63
The dead space
between the stars.

381
0:40:30,93 --> 0:40:33,280
And this, the seat that
we must change for heaven.

382
0:40:38,274 --> 0:40:42,860
I cannot breed them.
So help me, I have tried.

383
0:40:43,662 --> 0:40:46,746
We need more Replicants
than can ever be assembled.

384
0:40:46,811 --> 0:40:50,417
Millions, so we can be
trillions more.

385
0:40:52,247 --> 0:40:55,210
We could storm Eden
and retake her.

386
0:41:7,574 --> 0:41:10,65
Tyrell's final trick:

387
0:41:10,560 --> 0:41:12,553
Procreation.

388
0:41:12,650 --> 0:41:16,36
Perfected, then lost.

389
0:41:17,129 --> 0:41:19,520
But there is a child.

390
0:41:22,106 --> 0:41:23,999
Bring it to me.

391
0:41:24,296 --> 0:41:25,989
Sir.

392
0:41:33,992 --> 0:41:36,184
The best angel of all.

393
0:41:37,559 --> 0:41:39,153
Aren't you, Luv?

394
0:42:57,83 --> 0:42:59,576
The man with the green jacket.

395
0:42:59,577 --> 50:43:2,615
The one who killed Sapper.
Find out what he knows.

396
0:43:21,844 --> 0:43:23,340
Hi.

397
0:43:24,302 --> 0:43:26,593
Hello, hello, A-Boy.

398
0:43:26,814 --> 0:43:28,608
You alone?

399
0:43:34,508 --> 0:43:37,609
It's okay.
It's fine.

400
0:43:43,144 --> 0:43:45,179
Wanna buy a lady a cigarette?

401
0:43:51,804 --> 0:43:54,37
Oh, you don't even smile.

402
0:43:56,282 --> 0:43:58,271
Didn't you hear your friends?

403
0:43:58,634 --> 0:44:0,640
Don't you know what I am?

404
0:44:0,749 --> 0:44:2,203
Yeah.

405
0:44:2,531 --> 0:44:4,524
Guy eating rice.

406
0:44:5,738 --> 0:44:7,245
What's that?

407
0:44:8,357 --> 0:44:9,917
It's a tree.

408
0:44:10,247 --> 0:44:13,36
Oh. Never seen a tree before.

409
0:44:14,896 --> 0:44:16,538
It's pretty.

410
0:44:18,418 --> 0:44:20,122
It's dead.

411
0:44:21,564 --> 0:44:26,45
Now, who keeps a dead tree?

412
0:44:29,346 --> 0:44:30,853
Hmm?

413
0:44:33,185 --> 0:44:35,75
You're not gonna kill me,
are you?

414
0:44:35,116 --> 0:44:38,502
Depends.
What's your model number?

415
0:44:38,701 --> 0:44:41,579
Why don't you look under
my eye and find out.

416
0:44:43,852 --> 0:44:45,228
Oh!

417
0:44:45,951 --> 0:44:48,33
You don't like real girls.

418
0:44:51,189 --> 0:44:54,78
Well, I'm always here.

419
0:48:32,977 --> 0:48:34,684
Hi.

420
0:48:36,117 --> 0:48:37,772
You can't take those.

421
0:48:37,929 --> 0:48:41,245
Of course not. Proper channels
and paperwork. It's all here.

422
0:48:41,246 --> 0:48:42,771
Hold this for me.

423
0:48:44,599 --> 0:48:46,592
-Mmm. Yep. Here you go.
-Mmm.

424
0:49:3,810 --> 0:49:5,604
Coco is dead.

425
0:49:7,653 --> 0:49:9,546
Bones are gone.

426
0:49:10,174 --> 0:49:13,980
It's out. Already out.
How long'd that take?

427
0:49:14,681 --> 0:49:17,746
So, what do you have for me?
And don't say nothing.

428
0:49:18,547 --> 0:49:20,246
I found that.

429
0:49:20,959 --> 0:49:22,498
A sock?

430
0:49:24,443 --> 0:49:26,652
-Where'd you find it?
-Sapper's.

431
0:49:26,682 --> 0:49:28,524
Anything else?

432
0:49:28,525 --> 0:49:29,524
I burned everything else.

433
0:49:29,555 --> 0:49:32,668
Then what's this?
What's that date?

434
0:49:32,669 --> 0:49:33,668
Is that a birthday?
Is that a death day?

435
0:49:33,701 --> 0:49:35,437
I don't know yet.

436
0:49:38,902 --> 0:49:41,753
Am I the only one that can see
the fuckin' sunrise here?

437
0:49:41,800 --> 0:49:44,689
This breaks the world, "K."

438
0:49:57,83 --> 0:49:59,613
You know,
I've known a lot of your kind.

439
0:50:1,775 --> 0:50:6,515
All useful, but with you,
I sometimes forget.

440
0:50:7,243 --> 0:50:10,42
We didn't have any of you
where I was a kid.

441
0:50:15,649 --> 0:50:18,139
Do you remember anything?

442
0:50:18,716 --> 0:50:21,340
Before you were under me,

443
0:50:21,341 --> 0:50:22,340
you have any memories
from before?

444
0:50:22,404 --> 0:50:24,695
I have memories,

445
0:50:26,254 --> 0:50:28,778
but they're not real.
They're just implants.

446
0:50:29,967 --> 0:50:32,552
Tell me one.

447
0:50:32,553 --> 0:50:33,552
From when you were a kid.

448
0:50:38,274 --> 0:50:40,991
I feel a little strange
sharing a childhood story,

449
0:50:41,16 --> 0:50:43,131
considering
I was never a child.

450
0:50:45,121 --> 0:50:48,600
Well, would it help you share
if I told you it was an order?

451
0:50:51,252 --> 0:50:54,2
I have one
about a toy that I had.

452
0:50:54,65 --> 0:50:55,759
A wooden horse.

453
0:50:57,109 --> 0:50:59,174
With an inscription
underneath.

454
0:51:2,185 --> 0:51:5,68
All I remember
is a group of boys

455
0:51:5,69 --> 0:51:6,68
trying to take it away
from me.

456
0:51:6,546 --> 0:51:8,59
So I run.

457
0:51:33,121 --> 0:51:34,997
I go looking for a place
to hide it,

458
0:51:35,28 --> 0:51:37,497
and the only place
is this dark furnace.

459
0:51:39,112 --> 0:51:42,597
It's very dark
and I'm very scared,

460
0:51:42,795 --> 0:51:45,181
but this horse is all I have,

461
0:51:45,182 --> 0:51:46,181
so I go in anyway.

462
0:51:58,720 --> 0:52:0,491
Later on, those kids find me,

463
0:52:0,516 --> 0:52:4,120
and they beat me to tell 'em
where it is, but I don't.

464
0:52:10,335 --> 0:52:11,859
And that's it.

465
0:52:12,686 --> 0:52:14,22
Hmm.

466
0:52:14,408 --> 0:52:17,14
Little "K,"
fighting for what's his.

467
0:52:18,626 --> 0:52:20,336
It's a good one.

468
0:52:26,835 --> 0:52:28,339
Look at me.

469
0:52:30,709 --> 0:52:33,598
We're all just lookin' out
for somethin' real.

470
0:52:38,564 --> 0:52:40,901
What happens if I finish that?

471
0:52:44,654 --> 0:52:47,57
Shouldn't I get back
to work, madam?

472
0:52:56,359 --> 0:52:58,550
Check back in after DNAbase.

473
0:53:11,976 --> 0:53:14,750
Officer KD6-3.7.

474
0:53:17,597 --> 0:53:19,65
Request.

475
0:53:19,90 --> 0:53:22,785
DNA records:
children born 6-10-21.

476
0:53:23,124 --> 0:53:25,116
Looking for anomalies.

477
0:53:32,637 --> 0:53:34,408
You have
the satcrystal backup?

478
0:53:40,451 --> 0:53:42,34
Okay.

479
0:53:42,35 --> 0:53:43,34
Run it raw.

480
0:54:19,957 --> 0:54:22,49
Mere data makes a man.

481
0:54:23,929 --> 0:54:26,519
A and C and T and G.

482
0:54:26,953 --> 0:54:30,907
The alphabet of you.
All from four symbols.

483
0:54:32,450 --> 0:54:34,115
I'm only two:

484
0:54:37,510 --> 0:54:39,105
1 and 0.

485
0:54:39,395 --> 0:54:42,987
Half as much but twice
as elegant, sweetheart.

486
0:54:44,26 --> 0:54:46,118
You don't prefer your madam?

487
0:54:48,599 --> 0:54:50,230
You were listening.

488
0:54:51,156 --> 0:54:52,651
Maybe.

489
0:54:54,401 --> 0:54:57,297
You didn't like her enough
to tell her the truth.

490
0:54:57,979 --> 0:55:0,170
6, 10 and 21.

491
0:55:4,126 --> 0:55:6,118
There's nothin' to tell.

492
0:55:6,518 --> 0:55:9,626
How many times
have you told me that story?

493
0:55:11,729 --> 0:55:13,622
Your memory?

494
0:55:14,600 --> 0:55:16,875
The date carved beneath.

495
0:55:17,188 --> 0:55:19,426
6, 10 and 21.

496
0:55:21,329 --> 0:55:23,168
Coincidence?

497
0:55:27,141 --> 0:55:29,532
A dangerous coincidence.

498
0:55:33,31 --> 0:55:35,621
I always knew
you were special.

499
0:55:36,965 --> 0:55:38,996
Maybe this is how.

500
0:55:44,62 --> 0:55:45,733
A child.

501
0:55:46,252 --> 0:55:48,643
Of woman born.

502
0:55:49,752 --> 0:55:52,142
Pushed into the world.

503
0:55:53,219 --> 0:55:54,980
Wanted.

504
0:55:56,6 --> 0:55:57,601
Loved.

505
0:56:0,432 --> 0:56:2,623
Well, if it were true,

506
0:56:3,802 --> 0:56:6,482
I'd be hunted
for the rest of my life

507
0:56:6,483 --> 0:56:7,482
by someone just like me.

508
0:56:9,444 --> 0:56:11,735
It's okay to dream a little.

509
0:56:12,404 --> 0:56:13,927
Isn't it?

510
0:56:14,458 --> 0:56:16,240
Not if you're us.

511
0:56:21,439 --> 0:56:22,953
Stop.

512
0:56:23,582 --> 0:56:27,46
Put up 4847
and 2181, side-by-side.

513
0:56:32,933 --> 0:56:37,124
They're identical. Translate.

514
0:56:39,201 --> 0:56:41,94
A boy and a girl.

515
0:56:42,526 --> 0:56:44,133
It's impossible.

516
0:56:44,976 --> 0:56:46,422
Why?

517
0:56:47,19 --> 0:56:49,829
Two people
can't have identical DNA.

518
0:56:51,375 --> 0:56:55,218
One of these isn't real.
It's a copy.

519
0:56:59,983 --> 0:57:3,568
They were both processed
at the Morrill Cole Orphanage.

520
0:57:5,354 --> 0:57:7,545
It says the girl died there.

521
0:57:7,725 --> 0:57:9,618
Genetic disorder.

522
0:57:10,704 --> 0:57:12,597
Galatians Syndrome.

523
0:57:13,253 --> 0:57:15,17
And the boy...

524
0:57:16,982 --> 0:57:18,603
...disappears.

525
0:57:20,704 --> 0:57:22,597
Where's the orphanage?

526
0:57:24,921 --> 0:57:26,861
You wanna go for a ride?

527
0:58:42,840 --> 0:58:44,972
Well, here we are.

528
0:58:58,100 --> 0:58:59,803
Buckle up.

529
0:59:58,848 --> 1:0:0,491
"K"?

530
1:0:52,124 --> 1:0:53,661
"K"? "K"?

531
1:0:55,466 --> 1:0:57,67
"K"? "K"? "K"? "K"? "K"?

532
1:1:50,443 --> 1:1:52,137
Stay back.

533
1:2:7,260 --> 1:2:8,729
Fire again.

534
1:2:9,111 --> 1:2:10,667
Fire again.

535
1:2:12,381 --> 1:2:13,883
Fire.

536
1:2:24,882 --> 1:2:27,173
200 feet to the east.

537
1:2:29,62 --> 1:2:30,541
Fire.

538
1:2:32,347 --> 1:2:33,916
Go north.

539
1:2:35,882 --> 1:2:37,434
Fire.

540
1:2:38,120 --> 1:2:41,107
Stop. 20 degrees east.

541
1:2:42,897 --> 1:2:44,292
Stop.

542
1:2:44,589 --> 1:2:46,167
Zoom in.

543
1:2:47,506 --> 1:2:49,42
Closer.

544
1:2:52,253 --> 1:2:54,376
Oh, come on.

545
1:2:55,347 --> 1:2:56,853
Get up.

546
1:2:57,253 --> 1:2:59,64
Do your fucking job.

547
1:3:0,254 --> 1:3:2,48
Find the child.

548
1:3:38,39 --> 1:3:39,633
Watch the car.

549
1:5:18,319 --> 1:5:19,780
Every last piece,

550
1:5:19,805 --> 1:5:22,613
or I'll put you outside
where the sky is raining,

551
1:5:22,638 --> 1:5:24,630
where it's raining fire!

552
1:5:24,837 --> 1:5:26,554
You're in here to work.

553
1:5:26,585 --> 1:5:29,976
And if you're not working,
I don't need you.

554
1:5:30,73 --> 1:5:32,65
I don't need any of...

555
1:5:34,644 --> 1:5:36,152
Hi.

556
1:5:42,629 --> 1:5:45,491
The nickel
is for the colonial ships.

557
1:5:45,540 --> 1:5:47,919
Closest any of them
or any of us is gonna get

558
1:5:47,944 --> 1:5:51,356
to that grand life
off-world.

559
1:5:52,429 --> 1:5:54,984
And I encourage play, I do.

560
1:5:54,985 --> 1:5:55,984
Keeps 'em occupied and it
makes 'em nimble, right?

561
1:5:56,83 --> 1:5:58,474
But it's work.

562
1:5:59,277 --> 1:6:1,70
It's work that molds them
into a child worth havin'.

563
1:6:1,566 --> 1:6:5,51
So come on, now.

564
1:6:13,709 --> 1:6:15,203
What sort do you have in mind?

565
1:6:16,662 --> 1:6:18,655
'Cause I got all kinds.

566
1:6:22,166 --> 1:6:25,246
-Oh, no, no, no.
-I'm not buyin'.

567
1:6:27,795 --> 1:6:29,741
No, no, no.
This is just my game,

568
1:6:29,774 --> 1:6:32,857
and I play it fair.

569
1:6:32,881 --> 1:6:34,623
No. No, I mean,
bigger than you...

570
1:6:34,809 --> 1:6:36,602
Bigger than you
have tried to shut me down.

571
1:6:38,714 --> 1:6:41,33
Bigger than you.

572
1:6:41,58 --> 1:6:43,221
And they were men, at that.

573
1:6:43,354 --> 1:6:45,416
A little boy came through here
about 30 years back.

574
1:6:47,450 --> 1:6:50,637
-I need to see your records.
-Hmm.

575
1:6:51,33 --> 1:6:53,125
Legitimate placements,
private sales, everything.

576
1:6:54,179 --> 1:6:57,67
Don't keep records
that far back.

577
1:6:57,141 --> 1:6:59,232
-You don't?
-I don't.

578
1:6:59,257 --> 1:7:1,150
Sorry.

579
1:7:3,215 --> 1:7:5,269
Can't help you.

580
1:7:5,270 --> 1:7:6,269
- You can't?
- Nope.

581
1:7:9,745 --> 1:7:11,638
I think you can.

582
1:7:16,215 --> 1:7:17,893
I think someone like you
keeps a long memory.

583
1:7:20,3 --> 1:7:22,949
Now you can tell me
what you remember,

584
1:7:22,974 --> 1:7:24,959
or I can put a hole right here
and take a look.

585
1:7:24,984 --> 1:7:28,60
They were laughin'
and what was it you said?

586
1:7:41,707 --> 1:7:44,554
What did you say?

587
1:8:3,357 --> 1:8:5,116
Are you comin'?

588
1:8:15,784 --> 1:8:17,376
Where is it?

589
1:8:20,449 --> 1:8:21,930
Oh, God.

590
1:8:27,120 --> 1:8:28,814
Where, where, where, where?

591
1:8:31,131 --> 1:8:33,387
I don't see it. Here.

592
1:8:42,248 --> 1:8:43,817
It's gone.

593
1:8:45,936 --> 1:8:48,526
It's the entire year.

594
1:8:50,74 --> 1:8:51,768
I didn't do that.

595
1:8:52,455 --> 1:8:53,984
That wasn't me.

596
1:8:57,488 --> 1:9:1,278
I didn't. Wasn't me.

597
1:13:34,640 --> 1:13:37,518
I always told you.

598
1:13:37,519 --> 1:13:38,519
You're special.

599
1:13:42,722 --> 1:13:44,825
Born.

600
1:13:44,826 --> 1:13:45,825
Not made.

601
1:13:49,852 --> 1:13:51,696
Hidden with care.

602
1:13:55,44 --> 1:13:57,136
A real boy now.

603
1:13:59,722 --> 1:14:2,112
A real boy needs a real name.

604
1:14:3,511 --> 1:14:5,88
Joe.

605
1:14:6,689 --> 1:14:8,189
"Joe"?

606
1:14:8,244 --> 1:14:10,572
You're too important for "K."

607
1:14:11,367 --> 1:14:13,641
Your mother
would've named you.

608
1:14:16,542 --> 1:14:17,970
Joe.

609
1:14:20,125 --> 1:14:22,317
-Joe.
-Stop.

610
1:14:28,863 --> 1:14:31,874
How do I know if a memory
is an implant or not?

611
1:14:35,600 --> 1:14:37,559
Who makes the memories?

612
1:15:9,96 --> 1:15:10,989
Dr. Ana Stelline?

613
1:15:14,769 --> 1:15:16,276
A visitor.

614
1:15:18,751 --> 1:15:20,229
Is that okay?

615
1:15:20,940 --> 1:15:22,457
Yes.

616
1:15:24,125 --> 1:15:26,18
It's just unusual.

617
1:15:27,609 --> 1:15:32,90
Nice to meet you,
Officer KD6-3.7.

618
1:15:36,268 --> 1:15:40,52
Sorry. It's a compromised
immune system.

619
1:15:40,548 --> 1:15:44,531
A life of freedom,
so long as it's behind glass.

620
1:15:44,892 --> 1:15:46,861
Is that why
you're not off-world?

621
1:15:46,896 --> 1:15:48,376
Yes.

622
1:15:48,449 --> 1:15:52,345
My parents had our passes
in pocket, but I took sick.

623
1:15:52,783 --> 1:15:57,554
So it was a new life for me.

624
1:15:57,867 --> 1:16:1,338
And they put me in my cage,

625
1:16:1,385 --> 1:16:4,642
filled it with everything
they could to keep me happy.

626
1:16:4,690 --> 1:16:9,228
Except company, of course.
And I was used to crowds.

627
1:16:12,498 --> 1:16:14,626
What can I help you with?

628
1:16:15,284 --> 1:16:18,294
Thought you might be able
to help me with a case.

629
1:16:19,222 --> 1:16:23,932
Oh, that's the most
interesting thing

630
1:16:23,933 --> 1:16:24,932
I've been offered
to help with in ages.

631
1:16:26,34 --> 1:16:29,420
Do you mind if I work
while you talk?

632
1:16:30,254 --> 1:16:31,761
Of course.

633
1:16:38,476 --> 1:16:40,966
I promise
I hear every word.

634
1:16:47,932 --> 1:16:50,917
They say you're the best
memory-maker there is.

635
1:16:51,18 --> 1:16:53,110
Well, then, they're kind.

636
1:16:54,302 --> 1:16:56,594
I love birthday parties.

637
1:17:0,258 --> 1:17:2,95
You work for Wallace.

638
1:17:2,464 --> 1:17:5,869
Subcontract.
I'm one of his suppliers.

639
1:17:6,316 --> 1:17:9,517
He offered to buy me out,

640
1:17:9,518 --> 1:17:10,517
but I take my freedom
where I can find it.

641
1:17:11,820 --> 1:17:13,514
Why are you so good?

642
1:17:14,109 --> 1:17:16,994
What makes your memories
so authentic?

643
1:17:17,66 --> 1:17:20,979
Well, there's a bit of
every artist in their work.

644
1:17:21,674 --> 1:17:25,557
But I was locked
in a sterile chamber at 8,

645
1:17:26,396 --> 1:17:28,840
so if I wanted to see
the world,

646
1:17:28,841 --> 1:17:29,840
I had to imagine it.

647
1:17:31,428 --> 1:17:34,270
Got very good at imagining.

648
1:17:35,907 --> 1:17:39,354
Wallace needs my talent
to maintain a stable product.

649
1:17:40,784 --> 1:17:42,975
I think it's only kind.

650
1:17:44,466 --> 1:17:46,755
Replicants live
such hard lives,

651
1:17:46,810 --> 1:17:49,879
made to do
what we'd rather not.

652
1:17:50,409 --> 1:17:52,42
I can't help your future,

653
1:17:52,75 --> 1:17:55,47
but I can give you
good memories

654
1:17:55,48 --> 1:17:56,47
to think back on and smile.

655
1:17:57,7 --> 1:17:58,831
It's nice.

656
1:17:58,832 --> 1:18:1,375
It's better than nice.
It feels authentic.

657
1:18:1,420 --> 1:18:4,328
And if you have
authentic memories,

658
1:18:4,714 --> 1:18:6,906
you have real human responses.

659
1:18:7,889 --> 1:18:9,574
Wouldn't you agree?

660
1:18:17,773 --> 1:18:19,761
Are they all constructed

661
1:18:20,163 --> 1:18:22,762
or do you ever use
ones that are real?

662
1:18:26,311 --> 1:18:29,420
It's illegal to use
real memories, officer.

663
1:18:31,431 --> 1:18:33,564
How can you tell
the difference?

664
1:18:33,606 --> 1:18:35,598
Can you tell if something

665
1:18:37,173 --> 1:18:38,795
really happened?

666
1:18:40,795 --> 1:18:43,86
They all think
it's about more detail.

667
1:18:43,743 --> 1:18:46,134
But that's not how
memory works.

668
1:18:46,974 --> 1:18:49,66
We recall with our feelings.

669
1:18:49,362 --> 1:18:52,549
Anything real
should be a mess.

670
1:18:54,246 --> 1:18:56,40
I can show you.

671
1:18:57,539 --> 1:18:59,34
Sit.

672
1:19:17,277 --> 1:19:21,847
Now, think about the memory
you want me to see.

673
1:19:22,607 --> 1:19:25,97
Not even that hard.
Just picture it.

674
1:19:26,190 --> 1:19:27,788
Let it play.

675
1:20:17,748 --> 1:20:20,39
Someone lived this, yes.

676
1:20:21,629 --> 1:20:23,214
This happened.

677
1:20:39,944 --> 1:20:41,678
I know it's real.

678
1:20:53,182 --> 1:20:54,885
I know it's real.

679
1:20:57,901 --> 1:21:1,204
God damn it!

680
1:21:45,312 --> 1:21:48,918
Officer KD6-3.7.

681
1:21:48,919 --> 1:21:49,918
Madam is calling you in.

682
1:21:49,949 --> 1:21:51,769
You're under arrest.
Drop your gun

683
1:21:51,794 --> 1:21:54,123
and keep your hands
where I can see 'em.

684
1:21:54,892 --> 1:21:55,986
- Cells.
- Cells.

685
1:21:55,987 --> 1:21:57,777
Have you ever
been in an institution?

686
1:21:57,778 --> 1:21:58,972
-Cells.
-Cells.

687
1:21:58,973 --> 1:22:0,958
When you're not
performing your duties,

688
1:22:0,959 --> 1:22:1,958
do they keep you
in a little box?

689
1:22:1,959 --> 1:22:3,53
-Cells.
-Cells.

690
1:22:3,54 --> 1:22:4,446
- Interlinked.
- Interlinked.

691
1:22:4,447 --> 1:22:6,432
What's it like
to hold the hand

692
1:22:6,433 --> 1:22:7,432
of someone you love?
Interlinked.

693
1:22:7,483 --> 1:22:10,223
Interlinked.

694
1:22:10,319 --> 1:22:11,483
Within cells interlinked.

695
1:22:11,484 --> 1:22:12,483
Within cells interlinked.

696
1:22:12,510 --> 1:22:13,703
- Dreadfully.
- Dreadfully.

697
1:22:13,704 --> 1:22:15,693
What's it like to
be filled with dread?

698
1:22:15,694 --> 1:22:16,788
-Dreadfully.
- Dreadfully.

699
1:22:16,789 --> 1:22:18,878
Do you like being
separated from other people?

700
1:22:18,879 --> 1:22:19,973
-Distinct.
-Distinct.

701
1:22:19,974 --> 1:22:22,63
-Dreadfully distinct.
-Dreadfully distinct.

702
1:22:22,64 --> 1:22:23,158
-Dark.
-Dark.

703
1:22:23,159 --> 1:22:24,647
Within cells interlinked.

704
1:22:24,648 --> 1:22:25,647
Within the cells
interlinked.

705
1:22:25,648 --> 1:22:28,433
- Within one stem.
- Within one stem.

706
1:22:28,434 --> 1:22:29,723
And dreadfully distinct.

707
1:22:29,724 --> 1:22:30,723
And dreadfully distinct.

708
1:22:30,724 --> 1:22:32,315
- Against the dark.
- Against the dark.

709
1:22:32,340 --> 1:22:34,532
A tall white
fountain played.

710
1:22:35,302 --> 1:22:37,494
A tall white
fountain played.

711
1:22:39,919 --> 1:22:42,67
You're not even
close to baseline.

712
1:22:48,142 --> 1:22:50,35
Out! Close the door.

713
1:22:50,929 --> 1:22:53,21
What the fuck is with you?

714
1:22:53,226 --> 1:22:55,352
I put you on a case.

715
1:22:55,384 --> 1:22:57,813
I impressed on you
the importance of that case,

716
1:22:57,845 --> 1:23:0,610
and then we pick you up

717
1:23:0,611 --> 1:23:1,610
fucking around
outside an upgrade center?

718
1:23:3,27 --> 1:23:5,595
Scan said you didn't look like
you on the inside.

719
1:23:5,620 --> 1:23:7,574
Miles off your baseline.

720
1:23:7,605 --> 1:23:9,256
Do you know what that means?

721
1:23:9,281 --> 1:23:10,775
I found the kid.

722
1:23:15,431 --> 1:23:18,227
He was set up
like a standard Replicant,

723
1:23:18,228 --> 1:23:19,227
put on a service job.

724
1:23:21,555 --> 1:23:23,737
Even he didn't know
who he was.

725
1:23:25,742 --> 1:23:27,433
-And?
-And it's done.

726
1:23:27,458 --> 1:23:29,638
What does that mean,
"it's done"?

727
1:23:29,639 --> 1:23:30,638
What you asked.

728
1:23:32,36 --> 1:23:33,584
It's done.

729
1:23:41,392 --> 1:23:43,754
You just stopped a bomb
from goin' off.

730
1:23:45,328 --> 1:23:46,918
You did good.

731
1:23:49,127 --> 1:23:51,252
I can help you
get outta this station alive,

732
1:23:51,277 --> 1:23:54,66
but you have 48 hours
to get back on track.

733
1:23:54,331 --> 1:23:56,321
Surrender your gun and badge.

734
1:23:56,376 --> 1:23:59,563
And your next baseline test
is outta my hands.

735
1:24:1,406 --> 1:24:2,994
Thank you, madam.

736
1:24:35,40 --> 1:24:36,664
You were right.

737
1:24:43,401 --> 1:24:45,671
You were right
about everything.

738
1:24:46,281 --> 1:24:47,765
Shh.

739
1:25:14,57 --> 1:25:17,443
Thought you weren't
interested, worky man.

740
1:25:20,527 --> 1:25:22,619
You liked her. I could tell.

741
1:25:25,551 --> 1:25:27,67
It's okay.

742
1:25:27,793 --> 1:25:29,333
She's real.

743
1:25:31,476 --> 1:25:33,568
I wanna be real for you.

744
1:25:34,860 --> 1:25:36,901
You are real for me.

745
1:25:37,961 --> 1:25:40,53
You have a special lady here.

746
1:25:58,265 --> 1:25:59,737
Okay.

747
1:26:0,58 --> 1:26:1,577
Let's do it.

748
1:26:23,333 --> 1:26:24,869
Look at you.

749
1:26:25,124 --> 1:26:27,166
Quiet now,
I have to sync.

750
1:29:23,198 --> 1:29:26,485
Joi is
anything you want her to be.

751
1:29:28,515 --> 1:29:31,647
Joi goes anywhere
you want her to go.

752
1:30:1,640 --> 1:30:5,187
99.9% detoxified water.

753
1:30:34,952 --> 1:30:36,444
It's from a tree.

754
1:30:36,445 --> 1:30:38,141
I'm done with you.

755
1:30:39,64 --> 1:30:40,578
You can go now.

756
1:30:52,271 --> 1:30:53,728
Quiet, now.

757
1:30:54,361 --> 1:30:56,55
I've been inside you.

758
1:30:56,705 --> 1:30:59,96
Not so much there
as you think.

759
1:31:18,149 --> 1:31:19,621
Coffee?

760
1:31:25,446 --> 1:31:27,660
They'll be comin'
after me soon.

761
1:31:36,409 --> 1:31:38,70
I'm coming with you.

762
1:31:38,899 --> 1:31:40,523
But not like this.

763
1:31:41,108 --> 1:31:43,278
If they come here
looking for you,

764
1:31:43,303 --> 1:31:45,678
they'll have access
to all my memories.

765
1:31:46,454 --> 1:31:49,29
You have to delete me
from the console.

766
1:31:50,38 --> 1:31:51,578
My present.

767
1:31:53,598 --> 1:31:55,140
Put me there.

768
1:31:57,312 --> 1:31:59,6
I can't do that.

769
1:32:0,495 --> 1:32:2,164
Think about it.

770
1:32:3,39 --> 1:32:5,691
If anything happens to this,
that's it.

771
1:32:6,722 --> 1:32:8,238
You're gone.

772
1:32:8,414 --> 1:32:9,925
Yes.

773
1:32:11,69 --> 1:32:12,613
Like a real girl.

774
1:32:18,665 --> 1:32:20,147
Please.

775
1:32:23,244 --> 1:32:25,37
Joe, please.

776
1:32:26,130 --> 1:32:27,807
I want this.

777
1:32:31,711 --> 1:32:33,518
But I can't do it myself.

778
1:32:51,465 --> 1:32:53,94
Break the antenna.

779
1:33:33,339 --> 1:33:35,122
I don't need a real horse.

780
1:33:38,17 --> 1:33:40,317
I don't need a real horse.
I just...

781
1:33:40,880 --> 1:33:42,389
I just wanna find out
where it's from.

782
1:33:42,390 --> 1:33:43,389
Okay.

783
1:33:53,23 --> 1:33:54,813
Radiation from a reactor?

784
1:34:2,493 --> 1:34:4,570
It matches a dirty bomb.

785
1:34:12,531 --> 1:34:15,101
There's only one place
that dirty.

786
1:34:16,612 --> 1:34:18,281
Nobody lives there.

787
1:35:9,165 --> 1:35:10,765
- Go to five.

788
1:35:11,455 --> 1:35:13,796
Four, 30 degrees to the left.

789
1:35:16,156 --> 1:35:17,679
Tilt up.

790
1:35:20,244 --> 1:35:22,155
Elevate to 400 feet.

791
1:35:28,77 --> 1:35:30,69
Radiation analysis.

792
1:35:32,954 --> 1:35:34,508
Move forward.

793
1:35:41,315 --> 1:35:42,813
Tilt up.

794
1:35:43,206 --> 1:35:44,685
Stop.

795
1:35:46,590 --> 1:35:48,158
Move forward.

796
1:35:48,879 --> 1:35:50,392
Go to five.

797
1:35:51,543 --> 1:35:53,502
Seven, move forward.

798
1:35:58,687 --> 1:36:0,131
Six.

799
1:36:1,459 --> 1:36:2,943
Stop.

800
1:36:5,532 --> 1:36:7,116
Go to seven.

801
1:36:7,729 --> 1:36:9,156
Eight.

802
1:36:10,118 --> 1:36:11,585
Nine.

803
1:36:15,255 --> 1:36:16,765
Heat analysis.

804
1:36:24,847 --> 1:36:26,305
Life.

805
1:36:26,901 --> 1:36:28,456
What is it?

806
1:36:29,90 --> 1:36:31,237
Guess we're about to find out.

807
1:36:41,333 --> 1:36:43,27
Too dark in here.

808
1:36:46,97 --> 1:36:47,611
I like him.

809
1:36:48,545 --> 1:36:50,119
He's a good boy.

810
1:36:51,348 --> 1:36:52,873
Where is he?

811
1:36:59,197 --> 1:37:0,699
I have no idea. He's off-duty.

812
1:37:1,837 --> 1:37:4,723
Check around.

813
1:37:4,824 --> 1:37:6,411
I checked

814
1:37:7,609 --> 1:37:9,673
anywhere a good boy
might go.

815
1:37:10,427 --> 1:37:12,22
You're too late.

816
1:37:15,52 --> 1:37:16,719
It's gone.

817
1:37:19,708 --> 1:37:21,501
He destroyed it.

818
1:37:23,735 --> 1:37:25,892
Everything about it.

819
1:37:26,346 --> 1:37:28,821
Well, except
for the box of bones

820
1:37:28,822 --> 1:37:29,821
that you already took.

821
1:37:33,801 --> 1:37:37,288
Which, I'll wager,
wasn't enough. Here you are.

822
1:37:45,133 --> 1:37:47,26
You tiny thing.

823
1:37:48,682 --> 1:37:52,44
In the face
of the fabulous new,

824
1:37:52,45 --> 1:37:53,44
your only thought
is to kill it?

825
1:37:53,708 --> 1:37:56,138
For fear of great change?

826
1:37:57,177 --> 1:38:0,167
You can't hold the tide
with a broom.

827
1:38:0,661 --> 1:38:2,554
Except that I did.

828
1:38:3,846 --> 1:38:5,540
Where is he?

829
1:38:9,220 --> 1:38:11,14
You're so sure.

830
1:38:12,290 --> 1:38:14,282
Because he told you.

831
1:38:14,695 --> 1:38:16,735
Because we never lie.

832
1:38:18,468 --> 1:38:21,647
I'm gonna tell Mr. Wallace
you tried to shoot me first.

833
1:38:22,504 --> 1:38:24,381
So I had to kill you.

834
1:38:29,28 --> 1:38:31,190
Then do what you gotta do.

835
1:38:32,213 --> 1:38:33,752
Madam.

836
1:39:5,580 --> 1:39:8,757
Location: Officer KD6-3.7.

837
1:43:56,790 --> 1:44:2,152
"Mightn't happen to have

838
1:44:2,662 --> 1:44:4,166
"a piece of cheese
about you, now?"

839
1:44:19,233 --> 1:44:20,803
Would you, boy?

840
1:44:26,166 --> 1:44:27,400
Treasure Island?

841
1:44:27,664 --> 1:44:29,244
He reads.

842
1:44:30,333 --> 1:44:31,862
That's good.

843
1:44:32,821 --> 1:44:34,339
Me, too.

844
1:44:35,346 --> 1:44:38,533
Not much else to do
around here at night anymore.

845
1:44:41,281 --> 1:44:45,719
"Many is the night
I dream of cheese,

846
1:44:49,343 --> 1:44:52,569
"toasted, mostly."

847
1:44:55,912 --> 1:44:57,637
What are you doing here?

848
1:45:0,789 --> 1:45:2,483
I heard the piano.

849
1:45:4,395 --> 1:45:5,990
Don't lie.

850
1:45:7,122 --> 1:45:8,624
It's rude.

851
1:45:10,673 --> 1:45:12,466
You're a cop.

852
1:45:13,630 --> 1:45:16,482
-I'm not here to take you in.
-Oh, yeah?

853
1:45:19,295 --> 1:45:20,816
Then, what?

854
1:45:22,909 --> 1:45:25,101
I just have some questions.

855
1:45:25,673 --> 1:45:27,366
What questions?

856
1:45:45,153 --> 1:45:46,650
Stay.

857
1:48:19,732 --> 1:48:22,846
Look,
I don't wanna hurt you.

858
1:48:23,78 --> 1:48:25,71
But you're not makin' it easy.

859
1:48:57,678 --> 1:49:2,858
â™ھ Like a river flows

860
1:49:2,859 --> 1:49:3,858
â™ھ Surely to the sea

861
1:49:4,811 --> 1:49:8,342
â™ھ Darling, so it goes

862
1:49:8,408 --> 1:49:13,468
â™ھ Some things are meant to be

863
1:49:14,200 --> 1:49:15,994
I like this song.

864
1:49:16,55 --> 1:49:19,862
â™ھ Take my hand

865
1:49:21,654 --> 1:49:26,472
â™ھ Take my whole life, too

866
1:49:26,529 --> 1:49:29,566
We could keep at this,
or we could get a drink.

867
1:49:29,590 --> 1:49:34,663
â™ھ For I can't help

868
1:49:35,85 --> 1:49:41,552
â™ھ Falling in love with you â™ھ

869
1:49:42,163 --> 1:49:43,744
I'll take the drink.

870
1:49:52,122 --> 1:49:54,15
This is really somethin'.

871
1:49:54,260 --> 1:49:56,53
The whole town
was somethin'.

872
1:49:56,502 --> 1:49:58,30
One time.

873
1:49:59,985 --> 1:50:1,978
Forget your troubles,

874
1:50:3,71 --> 1:50:4,964
see a show,

875
1:50:6,584 --> 1:50:8,477
gamble a little.

876
1:50:11,41 --> 1:50:13,531
Win some money,
lose some money.

877
1:50:14,433 --> 1:50:17,722
They made money
seem like candy.

878
1:50:18,100 --> 1:50:19,691
You like whiskey?

879
1:50:20,227 --> 1:50:23,409
I've got millions

880
1:50:23,410 --> 1:50:24,409
of bottles of whiskey.

881
1:50:38,804 --> 1:50:40,297
Here.

882
1:50:41,93 --> 1:50:42,657
Bleeding.

883
1:50:55,326 --> 1:50:56,772
Is it real?

884
1:50:57,416 --> 1:50:58,911
I don't know.

885
1:50:59,63 --> 1:51:0,577
Ask him.

886
1:51:17,223 --> 1:51:18,719
Ya got a name?

887
1:51:20,669 --> 1:51:23,467
Officer KD6-3.7.

888
1:51:23,914 --> 1:51:25,923
That's not a name.
That's a serial number.

889
1:51:27,973 --> 1:51:29,448
All right.

890
1:51:31,955 --> 1:51:33,463
Joe.

891
1:51:33,608 --> 1:51:35,557
What do you want, Joe?

892
1:51:36,731 --> 1:51:39,828
- I wanna ask you some questions.
- Like what?

893
1:51:46,287 --> 1:51:48,130
Like, what was her name?

894
1:51:48,377 --> 1:51:50,138
The mother of your child.

895
1:51:57,267 --> 1:51:59,160
What was she like?

896
1:52:9,797 --> 1:52:11,468
Did you live here together?

897
1:52:11,469 --> 1:52:13,86
Too many questions.

898
1:52:14,355 --> 1:52:16,648
I had your job.
I was good at it.

899
1:52:16,695 --> 1:52:19,182
- It was simpler then.
- Why are you making it complicated?

900
1:52:19,215 --> 1:52:21,774
- Why don't you just answer the question?
- What question?

901
1:52:21,799 --> 1:52:24,687
I didn't figure you,
as one for bullshit.

902
1:52:25,273 --> 1:52:27,67
What's her name?

903
1:52:40,234 --> 1:52:41,670
Rachael.

904
1:52:46,520 --> 1:52:48,513
Her name was Rachael.

905
1:52:52,506 --> 1:52:54,411
What happened to the kid?

906
1:52:57,353 --> 1:53:0,59
Who put it in the orphanage?
Was it you?

907
1:53:2,828 --> 1:53:5,19
I was long gone, by then.

908
1:53:8,501 --> 1:53:10,831
You didn't even meet your own kid?

909
1:53:13,411 --> 1:53:14,885
Why?

910
1:53:15,698 --> 1:53:17,989
Because that was the plan.

911
1:53:20,95 --> 1:53:22,625
I showed them how to
scramble the records,

912
1:53:22,650 --> 1:53:24,321
cover their tracks.

913
1:53:25,300 --> 1:53:27,989
Everyone had a part.
Mine was to leave.

914
1:53:29,445 --> 1:53:32,104
Then the Blackout came,
baked over everything.

915
1:53:32,129 --> 1:53:34,507
Couldn't have found the child,
if I tried.

916
1:53:34,749 --> 1:53:36,332
Did you want to?

917
1:53:36,455 --> 1:53:38,941
- Not really.
- Why not?

918
1:53:39,34 --> 1:53:41,978
Because we were being hunted!

919
1:53:42,143 --> 1:53:44,689
I didn't want our child found.

920
1:53:44,930 --> 1:53:47,955
Taken apart. Dissected!

921
1:53:51,997 --> 1:53:54,841
Sometimes, to love someone...

922
1:53:56,973 --> 1:53:58,868
you gotta be a stranger.

923
1:54:20,105 --> 1:54:21,637
To strangers!

924
1:54:38,965 --> 1:54:42,403
â™ھ It's quarter to three,

925
1:54:42,691 --> 1:54:45,842
â™ھ there's no one in the place

926
1:54:46,436 --> 1:54:48,652
â™ھ except you and me

927
1:54:52,938 --> 1:54:55,521
So, set 'em up, Joe,

928
1:54:57,57 --> 1:54:59,677
â™ھ I got a little story...

929
1:55:2,191 --> 1:55:4,512
â™ھ you oughtta know

930
1:55:7,513 --> 1:55:10,253
â™ھ We're drinkin', my friend,

931
1:55:11,622 --> 1:55:13,409
â™ھ to the end

932
1:55:15,253 --> 1:55:18,321
â™ھ of a brief episode

933
1:55:21,365 --> 1:55:24,566
â™ھ Make it one for my baby

934
1:55:27,673 --> 1:55:30,103
â™ھ and one more for the road.

935
1:56:33,432 --> 1:56:34,961
What'd you do?

936
1:56:35,231 --> 1:56:37,25
Who'd you bring?

937
1:56:38,715 --> 1:56:41,211
- No one.
- Oh, yeah?

938
1:56:46,729 --> 1:56:48,606
Target locked.

939
1:56:50,627 --> 1:56:52,520
They know you're here.

940
1:56:53,744 --> 1:56:55,538
I came alone.

941
1:59:2,309 --> 1:59:3,909
Bad dog!

942
1:59:20,875 --> 1:59:22,406
Stop!

943
1:59:38,471 --> 1:59:41,125
I do hope you're satisfied
with our product.

944
1:59:41,687 --> 1:59:43,211
I love you.

945
2:2:56,940 --> 2:2:58,431
Hey.

946
2:2:58,931 --> 2:3:1,688
There's someone who wants
to meet you.

947
2:3:2,935 --> 2:3:4,629
You can trust us.

948
2:3:12,667 --> 2:3:15,644
You must want me to look up
and to the left.

949
2:3:21,426 --> 2:3:23,120
This is Freysa.

950
2:3:23,615 --> 2:3:25,924
She fought with Sapper on Calantha.

951
2:3:25,949 --> 2:3:27,581
I recognize you.

952
2:3:29,862 --> 2:3:32,234
Did you help him hide the child?

953
2:3:32,390 --> 2:3:33,757
Oh...

954
2:3:34,67 --> 2:3:35,773
I was there.

955
2:3:39,394 --> 2:3:41,586
I saw a miracle delivered.

956
2:3:42,825 --> 2:3:46,112
A perfect little face crying up at me.

957
2:3:46,707 --> 2:3:48,600
Mad as thunder.

958
2:4:2,35 --> 2:4:3,662
Were you with her?...

959
2:4:5,519 --> 2:4:7,2
Rachael?

960
2:4:7,126 --> 2:4:9,119
I held her as she died.

961
2:4:10,718 --> 2:4:12,279
We hid the child,

962
2:4:12,334 --> 2:4:15,68
and made a vow to keep our secret.

963
2:4:15,611 --> 2:4:18,101
That's why Sapper let you kill him.

964
2:4:19,308 --> 2:4:20,876
I knew...

965
2:4:21,8 --> 2:4:25,265
that baby meant we are more
than just slaves.

966
2:4:26,520 --> 2:4:29,110
If a baby can come from one of us,

967
2:4:29,377 --> 2:4:32,395
we are our own masters.

968
2:4:32,722 --> 2:4:35,113
"More human than humans".

969
2:4:37,239 --> 2:4:39,132
A revolution is coming.

970
2:4:39,476 --> 2:4:41,667
And we're building an army.

971
2:4:42,850 --> 2:4:45,42
I want to free our people.

972
2:4:53,494 --> 2:4:57,79
If you want to be free, join us.

973
2:5:2,423 --> 2:5:5,360
Deckard, Sapper, you, me;

974
2:5:5,385 --> 2:5:9,19
our lives mean nothing
next to a storm that's coming.

975
2:5:10,109 --> 2:5:14,499
Dying for the right cause is the
most human thing we can do.

976
2:5:17,454 --> 2:5:19,645
You led to Wallace to Deckard.

977
2:5:20,368 --> 2:5:24,244
You cannot allow Deckard
to lead Wallace to me.

978
2:5:24,831 --> 2:5:27,2
You must kill Deckard.

979
2:5:36,199 --> 2:5:39,88
Deckard only wanted
his baby to be safe.

980
2:5:39,836 --> 2:5:41,630
And she is.

981
2:5:43,531 --> 2:5:45,23
When the time comes,

982
2:5:45,55 --> 2:5:47,108
I will show her to the world.

983
2:5:47,142 --> 2:5:49,231
And se will lead our army.

984
2:5:49,278 --> 2:5:50,764
She?

985
2:5:50,947 --> 2:5:52,641
Of course.

986
2:5:53,15 --> 2:5:55,107
Rachael had a daughter.

987
2:5:56,299 --> 2:5:59,436
With my own eyes, I saw her come.

988
2:6:0,181 --> 2:6:3,357
I dressed her blue when
it was time for her to go.

989
2:6:3,382 --> 2:6:5,673
It was a boy that you hid.

990
2:6:7,500 --> 2:6:10,310
That is just a piece of the puzzle.

991
2:6:27,352 --> 2:6:29,650
You imagined it was you?

992
2:6:31,439 --> 2:6:32,798
Oh.

993
2:6:33,171 --> 2:6:34,689
You did.

994
2:6:35,317 --> 2:6:36,829
You did.

995
2:6:39,486 --> 2:6:41,578
We all wish it was us.

996
2:6:43,247 --> 2:6:45,140
That's why we believe.

997
2:7:1,676 --> 2:7:3,569
Someone lived this, yes.

998
2:7:5,972 --> 2:7:10,552
I showed them how to scramble
the records, cover their tracks.

999
2:7:10,650 --> 2:7:13,538
With my own eyes,
I saw her come.

1000
2:7:14,830 --> 2:7:18,515
I dressed her in blue when
it was time for her to go.

1001
2:7:19,256 --> 2:7:22,360
There's a bit of every
artist in their work.

1002
2:8:0,19 --> 2:8:2,111
Always jumping, that one.

1003
2:8:3,303 --> 2:8:6,463
Never a thought, what to do,
if it made land.

1004
2:8:7,590 --> 2:8:12,171
All the courage in the world
cannot alter fact.

1005
2:8:16,907 --> 2:8:22,85
I have wanted to meet you
for so very long.

1006
2:8:40,529 --> 2:8:43,118
You are a wonder to me,
Mr Deckard.

1007
2:8:49,27 --> 2:8:50,692
I had the lock.

1008
2:8:52,427 --> 2:8:54,618
I found the key.

1009
2:8:55,903 --> 2:9:0,406
Yet the pins do not align,
the door remains locked.

1010
2:9:3,122 --> 2:9:6,508
I need a specimen to reach it, Mr Deckard.

1011
2:9:10,289 --> 2:9:11,764
The child.

1012
2:9:13,175 --> 2:9:15,68
I need the child.

1013
2:9:16,261 --> 2:9:18,734
To teach them all to fly.

1014
2:9:27,186 --> 2:9:31,69
"And God remembered Rachel,

1015
2:9:33,82 --> 2:9:34,736
"He heeded her

1016
2:9:35,670 --> 2:9:37,563
"and opened her womb."

1017
2:9:38,280 --> 2:9:40,132
Do you like our owl?

1018
2:9:42,729 --> 2:9:44,576
It's artificial?

1019
2:9:45,524 --> 2:9:47,260
Of course it is.

1020
2:9:48,908 --> 2:9:50,721
Must be expensive.

1021
2:9:52,387 --> 2:9:53,840
Very.

1022
2:9:53,891 --> 2:9:55,585
I'm Rachael.

1023
2:9:56,74 --> 2:9:57,569
Deckard.

1024
2:10:9,526 --> 2:10:11,120
Is it the same,...

1025
2:10:12,597 --> 2:10:14,841
now as then,...

1026
2:10:17,673 --> 2:10:19,864
the moment you met her?

1027
2:10:29,617 --> 2:10:32,909
All these years you
looked back on that day,

1028
2:10:32,934 --> 2:10:35,980
drunk on the memory
of its perfection.

1029
2:10:39,271 --> 2:10:41,562
How shiny, her lips!

1030
2:10:41,667 --> 2:10:44,367
How instant, your connection!

1031
2:10:47,357 --> 2:10:49,93
Did it never occur to you,

1032
2:10:49,118 --> 2:10:52,342
that's why you were summoned
in the first place?

1033
2:10:53,792 --> 2:10:56,714
Designed to do nothing short of,
fall for her,

1034
2:10:56,739 --> 2:10:59,339
right then and there.

1035
2:11:1,609 --> 2:11:4,62
All to make that single,

1036
2:11:4,102 --> 2:11:5,593
perfect...

1037
2:11:5,640 --> 2:11:7,181
specimen.

1038
2:11:10,203 --> 2:11:12,992
That is, if you were designed.

1039
2:11:14,553 --> 2:11:16,61
Love,

1040
2:11:16,316 --> 2:11:19,104
or mathematical precision.

1041
2:11:24,730 --> 2:11:26,206
Yes?

1042
2:11:26,996 --> 2:11:28,503
No?

1043
2:11:32,987 --> 2:11:35,79
I know what's real.

1044
2:11:59,90 --> 2:12:2,473
It was very clever to keep
yourself empty of information.

1045
2:12:2,498 --> 2:12:6,83
And all it cost you was, everything.

1046
2:12:10,244 --> 2:12:12,535
But you can still help me.

1047
2:12:13,827 --> 2:12:17,14
You help help in the hiding.

1048
2:12:19,486 --> 2:12:21,359
Where did they go?

1049
2:12:23,77 --> 2:12:25,169
I know, you know something.

1050
2:12:26,217 --> 2:12:27,665
Help me...

1051
2:12:28,592 --> 2:12:32,144
and very, very good things
can come to you.

1052
2:12:37,815 --> 2:12:39,609
You don't have children.

1053
2:12:43,312 --> 2:12:44,708
Do you?

1054
2:12:45,181 --> 2:12:47,571
Oh, I have millions.

1055
2:12:49,959 --> 2:12:53,145
You think I have nothing to offer
but pain?

1056
2:12:53,441 --> 2:12:55,135
Only, I know...

1057
2:12:56,528 --> 2:12:58,122
you love pain.

1058
2:12:59,513 --> 2:13:3,950
Pain reminds you,
the joy you felt was real.

1059
2:13:5,974 --> 2:13:7,682
More joy, then!

1060
2:13:14,45 --> 2:13:16,37
Do not be afraid.

1061
2:13:30,873 --> 2:13:32,467
An angel...

1062
2:13:33,693 --> 2:13:35,586
made again.

1063
2:13:39,304 --> 2:13:40,831
For you.

1064
2:14:14,979 --> 2:14:16,695
Did you miss me?

1065
2:14:34,764 --> 2:14:36,525
Don't you love me?

1066
2:14:55,469 --> 2:14:57,168
Her eyes were green.

1067
2:15:14,680 --> 2:15:16,450
Off-world,...

1068
2:15:17,82 --> 2:15:20,70
I have everything I need
to make you talk.

1069
2:15:22,244 --> 2:15:24,635
You do not know what pain is, yet.

1070
2:15:26,524 --> 2:15:28,201
You will learn.

1071
2:15:40,159 --> 2:15:42,52
Hello handsome.

1072
2:15:58,871 --> 2:16:1,461
What day, hm?

1073
2:16:5,148 --> 2:16:7,41
You look lonely.

1074
2:16:8,128 --> 2:16:10,21
I can fix that.

1075
2:16:13,512 --> 2:16:16,337
You look like a good Joe.

1076
2:16:51,545 --> 2:16:56,863
Dying for the right cause is the
most human thing we can do.

1077
2:16:59,886 --> 2:17:2,277
Because you've
nevert seen a miracle.

1078
2:17:40,693 --> 2:17:44,65
You are entering Los Angeles Airport,
restricted airspace

1079
2:17:44,104 --> 2:17:45,624
Confirm your identity.

1080
2:17:45,649 --> 2:17:49,234
Transport S-14 Branch D, confirmed.

1081
2:17:49,616 --> 2:17:52,194
Base, this is 06 outbound...

1082
2:17:54,430 --> 2:17:56,124
Where are we going?

1083
2:17:57,117 --> 2:17:58,612
Home.

1084
2:18:53,639 --> 2:18:57,570
Drive 2 down.
Backup engaged.

1085
2:18:58,122 --> 2:18:59,569
Warning.

1086
2:18:59,594 --> 2:19:2,184
- Can we make it?
- We're too low!

1087
2:19:2,728 --> 2:19:4,312
Take us back!

1088
2:19:53,317 --> 2:19:54,886
Get us up!

1089
2:20:19,180 --> 2:20:20,759
Open the door.

1090
2:22:13,323 --> 2:22:15,55
I am the best one.

1091
2:22:55,972 --> 2:22:57,851
Off-world is waiting.

1092
2:25:11,48 --> 2:25:13,507
Joe. Joe!

1093
2:25:23,684 --> 2:25:25,201
Joe!

1094
2:26:4,331 --> 2:26:6,591
You should've let me die out there.

1095
2:26:7,562 --> 2:26:9,130
You did.

1096
2:26:12,890 --> 2:26:14,718
You drowned out there.

1097
2:26:20,439 --> 2:26:23,256
You're free to meet your daughter, now.

1098
2:27:47,785 --> 2:27:50,276
All the best memories are hers.

1099
2:27:59,400 --> 2:28:0,920
Why?

1100
2:28:3,473 --> 2:28:5,232
Who am I to you?

1101
2:28:14,427 --> 2:28:16,209
Go meet your daughter.

1102
2:28:22,369 --> 2:28:24,63
You OK?

1103
2:31:0,43 --> 2:31:1,645
Just a moment.

1104
2:31:4,124 --> 2:31:6,141
Beautiful, isn't it?
