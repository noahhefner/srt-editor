1
00:04:56,775 --> 00:05:00,295
‫I hope you don't mind me
‫taking the liberty.

2
00:05:02,655 --> 00:05:04,912
I was careful
not to drag in any dirt.

3
00:05:05,061 --> 00:05:07,371
I don't mind the dirt.

4
00:05:08,088 --> 00:05:10,356
I do mind

5
00:05:11,819 --> 00:05:13,995
unannounced visits.

6
00:05:14,535 --> 00:05:17,175
You police?

7
00:05:19,704 --> 00:05:21,568
Are you Sapper Morton?
Civic number NK68514?

8
00:05:22,811 --> 00:05:27,550
I'm a farmer.

9
00:05:27,616 --> 00:05:29,546
I saw that.

10
00:05:29,790 --> 00:05:31,327
What do you farm?

11
00:05:31,855 --> 00:05:33,796
It's a protein farm.

12
00:05:40,821 --> 00:05:42,838
Wallace design.

13
00:05:43,311 --> 00:05:45,408
Is that what I smell?

14
00:05:46,956 --> 00:05:48,650
Grow that just for me.

15
00:05:49,202 --> 00:05:51,108
Garlic.

16
00:05:52,041 --> 00:05:53,731
Garlic.

17
00:05:53,732 --> 00:11:39,463
Go on, try some.

18
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:57,133
No, thank you.

19
00:05:57,935 --> 00:05:59,629
I prefer to keep
an empty stomach

20
00:06:01,417 --> 00:06:05,795
until the hard part
of the day is done.

21
00:06:08,323 --> 00:06:10,052
How long you been here?

22
00:06:10,077 --> 00:06:11,714
Since 2020.

23
00:06:12,974 --> 00:06:15,814
But you haven't always
been a farmer, have you?

24
00:06:17,432 --> 00:06:19,046
Your bag.

25
00:06:19,242 --> 00:06:21,431
It's colonial medical use.

26
00:06:21,542 --> 00:06:23,258
Military issue.

27
00:06:25,629 --> 00:06:28,480
Where were you? Calantha?

28
00:06:32,860 --> 00:06:34,591
Must have been brutal.

29
00:06:35,052 --> 00:06:37,280
Plan on taking me in?

30
00:06:39,970 --> 00:06:41,911
Let them take a look inside?

31
00:06:42,162 --> 00:06:43,657
Mr. Morton,

32
00:06:44,610 --> 00:06:47,100
if taking you in
is an option,

33
00:06:51,257 --> 00:06:54,146
I would much prefer that
to the alternative.

34
00:06:55,363 --> 00:06:58,584
I'm sure you knew
it would be someone in time.

35
00:07:00,317 --> 00:07:02,399
I'm sorry it had to be me.

36
00:07:06,035 --> 00:07:07,946
Good as any.

37
00:07:12,689 --> 00:07:14,681
Now, if you don't mind,

38
00:07:15,270 --> 00:07:18,361
if you could just look up
and to the left, please.

39
00:08:15,007 --> 00:08:17,095
Please don't get up.

40
00:08:27,942 --> 00:08:31,210
How's it feel
killing your own kind?

41
00:08:34,869 --> 00:08:38,376
I don't retire my own kind
because we don't run.

42
00:08:40,380 --> 00:08:42,221
Only older models do.

43
00:08:42,246 --> 00:08:46,737
And you new models
are happy scraping the shit

44
00:08:51,225 --> 00:08:53,909
because you've never
seen a miracle.

45
00:09:35,015 --> 00:09:37,107
Just photograph everything.

46
00:09:48,744 --> 00:09:50,637
Madam, please.

47
00:09:50,848 --> 00:09:53,713
Incoming LAPD re-codec hash.

48
00:09:56,651 --> 00:09:59,639
You're hurt.
I'm not payin' for that.

49
00:10:00,434 --> 00:10:02,625
-I'll glue it.
-And?

50
00:10:08,642 --> 00:10:10,582
One of the tail-end Nexus 8s.

51
00:10:10,613 --> 00:10:13,481
He looks like he could
take your head off.

52
00:10:13,482 --> 00:10:14,481
He tried.

53
00:10:14,506 --> 00:10:16,645
He went AWOL after Calantha

54
00:10:16,704 --> 00:10:20,082
with a few more in his outfit
I wouldn't mind closin' out.

55
00:10:20,310 --> 00:10:22,601
-Just him?
-Just him.

56
00:10:23,167 --> 00:10:25,508
Come on home
for your baseline.

57
00:10:29,193 --> 00:10:30,999
One moment, madam.

58
00:11:18,594 --> 00:11:21,084
30 meters to maximum depth.

59
00:11:36,665 --> 00:11:38,244
What is that?

60
00:11:43,456 --> 00:11:45,441
I'll send a dig team.

61
00:11:46,313 --> 00:11:48,262
Come on home before the storm.

62
00:13:05,764 --> 00:13:09,445
Officer KD6-3.7.

63
00:13:09,470 --> 00:13:11,562
-Let's begin. Ready?
- Yes, sir.

64
00:13:12,731 --> 00:13:14,364
Recite your baseline.

65
00:13:14,389 --> 00:13:17,576
And blood-black
nothingness began to spin

66
00:13:19,269 --> 00:13:21,926
A system of cells
interlinked within cells

67
00:13:21,951 --> 00:13:24,247
interlinked within cells

68
00:13:24,248 --> 00:13:25,247
interlinked within one stem.

69
00:13:25,272 --> 00:13:27,077
Fuck off, skin-job.

70
00:13:28,750 --> 00:13:32,501
And dreadfully distinct
Against the dark,

71
00:13:32,502 --> 00:13:33,501
a tall white fountain played.

72
00:13:34,664 --> 00:13:35,957
- Cells.
- Cells.

73
00:13:35,982 --> 00:13:37,889
Have you ever been
in an institution?

74
00:13:37,914 --> 00:13:39,206
-Cells.
- Cells.

75
00:13:39,207 --> 00:13:40,500
Do they
keep you in a cell?

76
00:13:40,501 --> 00:13:41,794
-Cells.
- Cells.

77
00:13:41,795 --> 00:13:43,681
When you're not
performing your duties,

78
00:13:43,682 --> 00:13:44,681
do they keep you
in a little box?

79
00:13:44,682 --> 00:13:45,775
-Cells.
- Cells.

80
00:13:45,776 --> 00:13:47,667
- Interlinked.
- Interlinked.

81
00:13:47,668 --> 00:13:49,508
What's it like to hold
the hand of someone you love?

82
00:13:49,509 --> 00:13:51,001
-Interlinked.
- Interlinked.

83
00:13:51,002 --> 00:13:52,842
Did they teach you
how to feel finger to finger?

84
00:13:52,843 --> 00:13:54,236
-Interlinked.
- Interlinked.

85
00:13:54,237 --> 00:13:55,928
Do you long for having
your heart interlinked?

86
00:13:55,929 --> 00:13:57,321
-Interlinked.
- Interlinked.

87
00:13:57,322 --> 00:13:59,113
Do you dream
about being interlinked?

88
00:13:59,114 --> 00:13:59,909
Interlinked.

89
00:13:59,910 --> 00:14:01,700
What's it like to hold
your child in your arms?

90
00:14:01,701 --> 00:14:02,945
-Interlinked.
- Interlinked.

91
00:14:02,946 --> 00:14:04,686
Do you feel that there's
a part of you that's missing?

92
00:14:04,687 --> 00:14:05,881
-Interlinked.
- Interlinked.

93
00:14:05,882 --> 00:14:08,568
- Within cells interlinked.
- Within cells interlinked.

94
00:14:08,569 --> 00:14:10,001
Why don't you
say that three times.

95
00:14:10,002 --> 00:14:11,001
Within cells interlinked.

96
00:14:11,028 --> 00:14:14,103
Within cells interlinked.

97
00:14:14,128 --> 00:14:16,110
Within cells interlinked.
Within cells interlinked.

98
00:14:19,065 --> 00:14:20,660
We're done.

99
00:14:21,944 --> 00:14:23,638
Constant "K."

100
00:14:24,141 --> 00:14:26,182
You can pick up your bonus.

101
00:14:27,318 --> 00:14:28,925
Thank you, sir.

102
00:14:28,987 --> 00:14:30,962
Caution, keep clear.

103
00:14:32,077 --> 00:14:34,143
Caution, keep clear.

104
00:14:37,135 --> 00:14:39,817
Connect to off-world

105
00:14:39,818 --> 00:14:40,817
any time, any place.

106
00:14:40,818 --> 00:14:43,305
Packages start at 20 minutes.

107
00:14:43,306 --> 00:14:45,100
Many options available.

108
00:14:49,838 --> 00:14:53,124
Joi goes anywhere
you want her to go.

109
00:14:53,620 --> 00:14:57,655
Connect to
off-world any time, any place.

110
00:15:41,036 --> 00:15:44,554
"K"? I didn't hear you.
You're early.

111
00:15:44,619 --> 00:15:46,611
You want me to come back?

112
00:15:46,839 --> 00:15:49,137
Just go scrub.

113
00:15:51,029 --> 00:15:52,761
Yes, ma'am.

114
00:15:54,468 --> 00:15:56,262
How was your meeting?

115
00:15:56,616 --> 00:15:58,641
The usual.

116
00:15:59,750 --> 00:16:01,743
How was your day?

117
00:16:02,498 --> 00:16:05,691
I'm getting cabin fever.

118
00:16:09,289 --> 00:16:11,580
99.9% detoxified water.

119
00:16:12,131 --> 00:16:14,123
I had an accident at work.
I think I ruined my shirt.

120
00:16:14,556 --> 00:16:16,526
I'm sure
I can fix that for you.

121
00:16:16,551 --> 00:16:18,556
Let me take a look at it.

122
00:16:24,458 --> 00:16:26,152
I need a drink.

123
00:16:27,037 --> 00:16:29,725
Do you want a drink first?

124
00:16:29,726 --> 00:16:30,725
Mmm-hmm.
Pour me one, will ya?

125
00:16:32,434 --> 00:16:34,028
I'm trying a new recipe.

126
00:16:34,138 --> 00:16:36,140
I just need
a bit more practice.

127
00:16:36,165 --> 00:16:37,794
Don't fuss.

128
00:16:40,308 --> 00:16:42,573
I should have
marinated it longer.

129
00:16:42,695 --> 00:16:44,503
I hope it isn't dry.

130
00:16:46,616 --> 00:16:50,306
Did you know
this song was released

131
00:16:50,307 --> 00:16:51,306
in 1966 on Reprise Records?

132
00:16:51,923 --> 00:16:54,154
It was number one
on the charts.

133
00:16:59,242 --> 00:17:00,826
It won't be much longer.

134
00:17:00,851 --> 00:17:03,422
Just putting on
the finishing touches.

135
00:17:07,277 --> 00:17:11,155
Okay, it's ready.
I hope you're gonna like it.

136
00:17:11,180 --> 00:17:13,138
I told you not to fuss.

137
00:17:14,942 --> 00:17:16,761
And yet...

138
00:17:19,346 --> 00:17:22,075
Voilأ ! Bon appأ©tit.

139
00:17:24,734 --> 00:17:26,786
I missed you, baby sweet.

140
00:17:28,631 --> 00:17:30,623
Honey, it's beautiful.

141
00:17:30,852 --> 00:17:32,716
Just put your feet up.

142
00:17:33,389 --> 00:17:35,182
Relax.

143
00:17:53,213 --> 00:17:55,205
Was a day, hmm?

144
00:17:56,418 --> 00:17:58,199
It was a day.

145
00:17:59,014 --> 00:18:00,976
Would you read to me?

146
00:18:02,312 --> 00:18:03,866
It'll make you feel better.

147
00:18:03,935 --> 00:18:07,365
-You hate that book.
-I don't wanna read either.

148
00:18:09,093 --> 00:18:10,420
Let's dance.

149
00:18:10,445 --> 00:18:13,001
Do you wanna dance, or do you
wanna open your present?

150
00:18:13,041 --> 00:18:14,636
What present?

151
00:18:18,457 --> 00:18:19,965
This one.

152
00:18:20,063 --> 00:18:21,715
What's the occasion?

153
00:18:21,846 --> 00:18:23,738
Let's just say

154
00:18:24,071 --> 00:18:27,345
-it's our anniversary.
-Is it?

155
00:18:28,352 --> 00:18:32,930
No, but let's just
say that it is.

156
00:18:33,559 --> 00:18:34,954
Okay?

157
00:18:38,496 --> 00:18:40,223
Happy anniversary.

158
00:18:41,299 --> 00:18:43,092
An emanator.

159
00:19:25,573 --> 00:19:27,009
Thank you.

160
00:19:27,049 --> 00:19:31,132
Honey, you can go anywhere
you want in the world now.

161
00:19:32,241 --> 00:19:34,358
Where do you wanna go first?

162
00:21:48,212 --> 00:21:50,715
I'm so happy
when I'm with you.

163
00:21:52,843 --> 00:21:55,011
You don't have to say that.

164
00:22:26,158 --> 00:22:28,939
The dig's come through.
We have a new lead.

165
00:22:29,636 --> 00:22:31,276
Get down here.

166
00:22:44,773 --> 00:22:48,946
Carbon read: 14.6 GPH.

167
00:23:08,833 --> 00:23:12,276
Your box
is a military footlocker

168
00:23:12,277 --> 00:23:13,276
issued to Sapper Morton,

169
00:23:13,611 --> 00:23:16,468
creatively repurposed
as an ossuary:

170
00:23:16,539 --> 00:23:18,156
a box of bones.

171
00:23:18,567 --> 00:23:20,559
Nothin' else in it but hair.

172
00:23:21,705 --> 00:23:24,986
The soil samples indicate that

173
00:23:24,987 --> 00:23:25,986
she's been buried
for 30 years.

174
00:23:26,551 --> 00:23:29,829
Bones all dismantled,
fully cleaned,

175
00:23:29,830 --> 00:23:30,829
meticulously laid to rest.

176
00:23:30,891 --> 00:23:32,486
"She"?

177
00:23:33,751 --> 00:23:35,668
Cause of death, Coco?

178
00:23:46,219 --> 00:23:49,843
No breaks,
no sign of trauma, except

179
00:23:50,627 --> 00:23:53,118
a fracture
through the ilium.

180
00:23:53,839 --> 00:23:56,784
It's a narrow birth canal.
Baby must have got stuck.

181
00:23:56,840 --> 00:23:59,753
- She was pregnant?
- Hmm.

182
00:24:00,018 --> 00:24:02,710
So he didn't kill her?

183
00:24:02,711 --> 00:24:03,710
Mmm. She died in childbirth.

184
00:24:05,522 --> 00:24:07,048
What's that?

185
00:24:08,102 --> 00:24:09,642
Go back.

186
00:24:10,407 --> 00:24:11,931
Closer.

187
00:24:13,264 --> 00:24:14,858
Closer.

188
00:24:17,568 --> 00:24:19,222
What's that?

189
00:24:20,804 --> 00:24:22,197
Huh.

190
00:24:22,291 --> 00:24:25,708
Notching in the iliac crest.

191
00:24:26,237 --> 00:24:29,540
It's fine-point,
like a scalpel.

192
00:24:30,546 --> 00:24:33,197
That looks like
an emergency C-section.

193
00:24:33,663 --> 00:24:37,148
The cuts are clean.
No sign of a struggle.

194
00:24:37,918 --> 00:24:39,741
He was a combat medic.

195
00:24:40,473 --> 00:24:42,770
Maybe he tried to save her
and he just couldn't.

196
00:24:42,809 --> 00:24:44,858
He didn't seem like
the saving type.

197
00:24:44,883 --> 00:24:47,317
He went to the trouble
of burying her.

198
00:24:47,525 --> 00:24:49,666
A sentimental skin-job.

199
00:24:51,622 --> 00:24:53,056
Sorry.

200
00:24:53,467 --> 00:24:55,339
So where's the kid?

201
00:24:56,728 --> 00:24:58,610
You scan the whole field?

202
00:24:58,649 --> 00:25:00,266
Just dirt and worms.

203
00:25:00,267 --> 00:25:01,266
No other bodies.

204
00:25:01,291 --> 00:25:02,922
Maybe he ate it.

205
00:25:51,788 --> 00:25:53,737
That's not possible.

206
00:25:56,206 --> 00:25:58,099
She was a Replicant.

207
00:26:00,662 --> 00:26:02,324
Pregnant.

208
00:26:11,285 --> 00:26:15,361
The world is built on a wall.

209
00:26:15,362 --> 00:26:16,361
It separates kind.

210
00:26:17,488 --> 00:26:20,073
Tell either side
there's no wall,

211
00:26:20,074 --> 00:26:21,073
you bought a war.

212
00:26:21,703 --> 00:26:23,370
Or a slaughter.

213
00:26:27,096 --> 00:26:29,089
So, what you saw

214
00:26:31,085 --> 00:26:32,937
didn't happen.

215
00:26:34,668 --> 00:26:36,136
Yes, madam.

216
00:26:36,161 --> 00:26:39,046
It is my job to keep order.

217
00:26:39,162 --> 00:26:42,051
That's what we do here.
We keep order.

218
00:26:43,925 --> 00:26:45,619
You want it gone?

219
00:26:47,086 --> 00:26:48,777
Erase everything.

220
00:26:48,826 --> 00:26:50,644
Even the child?

221
00:26:50,645 --> 00:26:51,644
All trace.

222
00:26:55,878 --> 00:26:58,047
You have anything more to say?

223
00:26:59,713 --> 00:27:02,773
I've never retired something
that was born before.

224
00:27:03,764 --> 00:27:05,652
What's the difference?

225
00:27:09,567 --> 00:27:12,057
To be born is to have a soul,
I guess.

226
00:27:13,134 --> 00:27:15,027
Are you telling me no?

227
00:27:16,007 --> 00:27:18,558
I wasn't aware
that was an option, madam.

228
00:27:18,594 --> 00:27:20,230
Attaboy.

229
00:27:23,296 --> 00:27:24,692
Hey.

230
00:27:24,873 --> 00:27:27,064
You've been getting on fine
without one.

231
00:27:27,455 --> 00:27:29,010
What's that, madam?

232
00:27:29,260 --> 00:27:30,852
A soul.

233
00:28:17,584 --> 00:28:22,562
And you new models
are happy scraping the shit

234
00:28:24,673 --> 00:28:27,219
because you've never seen
a miracle.

235
00:28:51,222 --> 00:28:53,789
Just checking in
on an old serial number.

236
00:28:58,679 --> 00:29:00,572
Confirmation DNA?

237
00:29:01,494 --> 00:29:03,268
I got hair.

238
00:29:20,291 --> 00:29:23,732
Oh! An old one.

239
00:29:24,395 --> 00:29:26,264
Pre-Blackout. Huh.

240
00:29:27,444 --> 00:29:29,636
That's gonna be tough.

241
00:29:30,597 --> 00:29:33,083
Not much from then.

242
00:29:33,084 --> 00:29:34,083
And what's there is

243
00:29:34,738 --> 00:29:36,532
thick milky.

244
00:29:37,412 --> 00:29:40,297
You can customize them
as much as you'd like.

245
00:29:40,673 --> 00:29:43,063
As human
as you want them to be.

246
00:29:43,554 --> 00:29:46,851
But your operation is strictly
a drill site, isn't it?

247
00:29:47,166 --> 00:29:50,548
I wouldn't waste your money
on intelligence,

248
00:29:50,549 --> 00:29:51,548
attachment or appeal.

249
00:29:52,257 --> 00:29:55,974
Unless you'd like to add some
pleasure models to your order.

250
00:30:09,296 --> 00:30:12,473
Would it be possible to
reschedule this call, please?

251
00:30:14,935 --> 00:30:17,388
Everyone remembers

252
00:30:17,389 --> 00:30:18,388
where they were
at the Blackout. You?

253
00:30:18,420 --> 00:30:20,772
That was a little
before my time.

254
00:30:20,828 --> 00:30:23,310
Mmm. I was home with my folks,

255
00:30:23,444 --> 00:30:26,114
then ten days of darkness.
Every machine stopped cold.

256
00:30:26,139 --> 00:30:28,656
When the lights came back,
we were wiped clean.

257
00:30:28,681 --> 00:30:32,517
Photos, files, every bit of
data... Ffft! Gone.

258
00:30:32,550 --> 00:30:34,535
Bank records, too.

259
00:30:34,536 --> 00:30:35,535
Didn't mind that.

260
00:30:35,638 --> 00:30:37,727
It's funny it's only paper
that lasted.

261
00:30:37,751 --> 00:30:40,618
I mean, we had
everything on drives.

262
00:30:40,619 --> 00:30:41,617
Everything, everything,
everything! Huh.

263
00:30:43,003 --> 00:30:46,091
My mom still cries
over the lost baby pictures.

264
00:30:46,227 --> 00:30:48,526
Well, it's a shame. You

265
00:30:48,527 --> 00:30:49,526
-must have been adorable.
-Hmm... Ah.

266
00:30:49,613 --> 00:30:51,644
Uh...

267
00:30:55,774 --> 00:30:58,563
Pretty fractured.
Not much on it.

268
00:30:59,526 --> 00:31:02,066
One of the last gens,
pre-Prohibition.

269
00:31:02,313 --> 00:31:05,566
Standard issue.
Made by Tyrell.

270
00:31:06,210 --> 00:31:07,745
And?

271
00:31:07,986 --> 00:31:10,074
Unremarkable.

272
00:31:10,075 --> 00:31:11,074
"Unremarkable"?

273
00:31:11,247 --> 00:31:14,187
There must be something
else we can find for him.

274
00:31:21,552 --> 00:31:24,142
Another prodigal
serial number returns.

275
00:31:25,673 --> 00:31:28,561
A 30-year-old open case
finally closed.

276
00:31:29,110 --> 00:31:30,949
Thank you, officer.

277
00:31:31,874 --> 00:31:34,289
I'm here for Mr. Wallace.
I'm Luv.

278
00:31:36,445 --> 00:31:38,180
He named you.

279
00:31:38,820 --> 00:31:40,656
Must be special.

280
00:31:41,246 --> 00:31:43,172
I'm here for Mr. Wallace.

281
00:31:43,173 --> 00:31:44,172
Follow me.

282
00:31:50,586 --> 00:31:54,072
The ancient models
give the entire endeavor
a bad name.

283
00:31:55,364 --> 00:32:00,044
What a gift, don't you think,
from Mr. Wallace to the world?

284
00:32:03,153 --> 00:32:05,908
The outer colonies
would never have flourished

285
00:32:05,909 --> 00:32:06,908
had he not bought Tyrell,

286
00:32:06,956 --> 00:32:09,048
revivified the technology.

287
00:32:09,895 --> 00:32:11,987
To say the least
of what we do.

288
00:32:15,317 --> 00:32:17,364
I see you're also a customer.

289
00:32:17,683 --> 00:32:20,200
Are you satisfied
with our product?

290
00:32:20,390 --> 00:32:24,074
She's very realistic.
Thank you.

291
00:32:24,900 --> 00:32:27,358
Here. All the junk is in here.

292
00:32:27,679 --> 00:32:30,568
Lucky for you,
Mr. Wallace is a data hoarder.

293
00:32:43,077 --> 00:32:45,316
No one's been
down here in ages.

294
00:32:48,255 --> 00:32:50,081
Sorry about that.

295
00:33:01,422 --> 00:33:05,055
All our memory bearings
from the time.

296
00:33:05,056 --> 00:33:06,055
They were all damaged
in the Blackout.

297
00:33:06,404 --> 00:33:08,899
But there are
sometimes fragments.

298
00:33:24,692 --> 00:33:26,226
You got a little boy.

299
00:33:26,218 --> 00:33:27,943
He shows you
his butterfly collection,

300
00:33:27,944 --> 00:33:28,943
plus the killing jar.

301
00:33:28,975 --> 00:33:30,911
I'd take him
to the doctor.

302
00:33:33,318 --> 00:33:35,690
There's a wasp
crawling on your arm.

303
00:33:35,691 --> 00:33:36,690
I'd kill it.

304
00:33:38,726 --> 00:33:41,828
You're reading a magazine.

305
00:33:41,829 --> 00:33:42,828
You come across a full-page
nude photo of a girl.

306
00:33:42,859 --> 00:33:45,021
Is this testing
whether I'm a Replicant

307
00:33:45,022 --> 00:33:46,021
or a lesbian, Mr. Deckard?

308
00:33:46,046 --> 00:33:48,365
Just answer
the questions, please.

309
00:33:51,870 --> 00:33:55,552
It was unclear what she was,
at least to someone.

310
00:33:55,700 --> 00:33:57,309
This was a test.

311
00:33:57,897 --> 00:34:00,089
We were difficult
to spot then.

312
00:34:01,794 --> 00:34:05,033
Was there anything unusual
about how you found her?

313
00:34:05,183 --> 00:34:07,800
To warrant an official
investigation?

314
00:34:10,232 --> 00:34:13,372
You know how people are
about old serial numbers.

315
00:34:13,883 --> 00:34:16,496
Everyone just sleeps better

316
00:34:16,497 --> 00:34:17,496
when they know
where they got to.

317
00:34:20,252 --> 00:34:21,827
She likes him.

318
00:34:23,061 --> 00:34:24,569
Who?

319
00:34:24,730 --> 00:34:27,121
This Officer Deckard.

320
00:34:28,314 --> 00:34:30,319
She's trying to provoke him.

321
00:34:33,711 --> 00:34:37,097
It is invigorating being asked
personal questions.

322
00:34:37,394 --> 00:34:39,088
Makes one feel

323
00:34:40,319 --> 00:34:42,259
desired.

324
00:34:43,082 --> 00:34:45,289
Do you enjoy
your work, officer?

325
00:34:49,691 --> 00:34:52,114
Please thank Mr. Wallace
for your time.

326
00:35:04,384 --> 00:35:07,069
You worked
with Officer Deckard

327
00:35:07,070 --> 00:35:08,069
back in the day.

328
00:35:08,823 --> 00:35:10,891
What can you tell me
about him?

329
00:35:11,387 --> 00:35:13,579
He liked to work alone.

330
00:35:14,565 --> 00:35:16,410
So did I.

331
00:35:18,371 --> 00:35:21,558
So we worked together
to keep it that way.

332
00:35:22,806 --> 00:35:24,409
That was it.

333
00:35:25,394 --> 00:35:27,713
Anything else
you can tell me?

334
00:35:29,330 --> 00:35:31,681
He wasn't long for this world.

335
00:35:33,931 --> 00:35:35,545
How so?

336
00:35:37,674 --> 00:35:40,065
Something in his eyes.

337
00:35:43,163 --> 00:35:45,653
Any idea how I could
contact him?

338
00:35:45,949 --> 00:35:47,473
None.

339
00:35:48,836 --> 00:35:51,127
He's nyugdأ­jas.

340
00:35:54,220 --> 00:35:55,743
Retired.

341
00:35:57,095 --> 00:35:58,627
What happened?

342
00:35:58,652 --> 00:36:01,142
Probably got what he wanted.

343
00:36:03,376 --> 00:36:05,169
To be alone.

344
00:36:30,012 --> 00:36:32,005
Welcome back, sir.

345
00:36:33,342 --> 00:36:36,133
You wanted to review
the new model, sir,

346
00:36:36,134 --> 00:36:37,133
before shipment?

347
00:36:38,057 --> 00:36:41,465
An angel
should never enter

348
00:36:41,466 --> 00:36:42,465
the kingdom of heaven

349
00:36:42,950 --> 00:36:44,817
without a gift.

350
00:36:47,062 --> 00:36:50,548
Can you at least pronounce,
"A child is born"?

351
00:36:53,082 --> 00:36:54,707
Hmm.

352
00:37:01,466 --> 00:37:03,269
A new model.

353
00:37:10,761 --> 00:37:13,151
Well, let us see her, then.

354
00:38:01,564 --> 00:38:04,213
The first thought

355
00:38:06,798 --> 00:38:08,791
one tends to fear,

356
00:38:10,032 --> 00:38:12,024
to preserve the clay.

357
00:38:14,625 --> 00:38:16,518
It's fascinating.

358
00:38:17,544 --> 00:38:20,287
Before we even know
what we are,

359
00:38:22,562 --> 00:38:24,287
we fear to lose it.

360
00:38:25,950 --> 00:38:27,691
Happy birthday.

361
00:38:37,129 --> 00:38:38,615
Now, let's have a look at you.

362
00:39:30,615 --> 00:39:33,119
We make angels

363
00:39:34,119 --> 00:39:38,323
in the service
of civilization.

364
00:39:38,323 --> 00:39:41,593
Yes, there were
bad angels once.

365
00:39:41,593 --> 00:39:43,996
I make good angels now.

366
00:39:29,943 --> 00:39:34,140
That is how I took us
to nine new worlds.

367
00:39:37,206 --> 00:39:38,701
Nine.

368
00:39:40,260 --> 00:39:43,815
A child can count to nine
on fingers.

369
00:39:43,844 --> 00:39:46,682
We should own the stars.

370
00:39:46,714 --> 00:39:48,291
Yes, sir.

371
00:39:51,133 --> 00:39:53,581
Every leap
of civilization

372
00:39:53,606 --> 00:39:56,262
was built off the back
of a disposable workforce.

373
00:39:56,293 --> 00:39:59,299
We lost our stomach
for slaves

374
00:39:59,535 --> 00:40:01,610
unless engineered.

375
00:40:04,768 --> 00:40:07,059
But I can only make so many.

376
00:40:12,763 --> 00:40:15,154
That barren pasture,

377
00:40:15,879 --> 00:40:18,129
empty

378
00:40:18,130 --> 00:40:19,129
and salted...

379
00:40:21,086 --> 00:40:22,580
...right here.

380
00:40:24,677 --> 00:40:28,063
The dead space
between the stars.

381
00:40:30,093 --> 00:40:33,280
And this, the seat that
we must change for heaven.

382
00:40:38,274 --> 00:40:42,860
I cannot breed them.
So help me, I have tried.

383
00:40:43,662 --> 00:40:46,746
We need more Replicants
than can ever be assembled.

384
00:40:46,811 --> 00:40:50,417
Millions, so we can be
trillions more.

385
00:40:52,247 --> 00:40:55,210
We could storm Eden
and retake her.

386
00:41:07,574 --> 00:41:10,065
Tyrell's final trick:

387
00:41:10,560 --> 00:41:12,553
Procreation.

388
00:41:12,650 --> 00:41:16,036
Perfected, then lost.

389
00:41:17,129 --> 00:41:19,520
But there is a child.

390
00:41:22,106 --> 00:41:23,999
Bring it to me.

391
00:41:24,296 --> 00:41:25,989
Sir.

392
00:41:33,992 --> 00:41:36,184
The best angel of all.

393
00:41:37,559 --> 00:41:39,153
Aren't you, Luv?

394
00:42:57,083 --> 00:42:59,576
The man with the green jacket.

395
00:42:59,577 --> 50:43:02,615
The one who killed Sapper.
Find out what he knows.

396
00:43:21,844 --> 00:43:23,340
Hi.

397
00:43:24,302 --> 00:43:26,593
Hello, hello, A-Boy.

398
00:43:26,814 --> 00:43:28,608
You alone?

399
00:43:34,508 --> 00:43:37,609
It's okay.
It's fine.

400
00:43:43,144 --> 00:43:45,179
Wanna buy a lady a cigarette?

401
00:43:51,804 --> 00:43:54,037
Oh, you don't even smile.

402
00:43:56,282 --> 00:43:58,271
Didn't you hear your friends?

403
00:43:58,634 --> 00:44:00,640
Don't you know what I am?

404
00:44:00,749 --> 00:44:02,203
Yeah.

405
00:44:02,531 --> 00:44:04,524
Guy eating rice.

406
00:44:05,738 --> 00:44:07,245
What's that?

407
00:44:08,357 --> 00:44:09,917
It's a tree.

408
00:44:10,247 --> 00:44:13,036
Oh. Never seen a tree before.

409
00:44:14,896 --> 00:44:16,538
It's pretty.

410
00:44:18,418 --> 00:44:20,122
It's dead.

411
00:44:21,564 --> 00:44:26,045
Now, who keeps a dead tree?

412
00:44:29,346 --> 00:44:30,853
Hmm?

413
00:44:33,185 --> 00:44:35,075
You're not gonna kill me,
are you?

414
00:44:35,116 --> 00:44:38,502
Depends.
What's your model number?

415
00:44:38,701 --> 00:44:41,579
Why don't you look under
my eye and find out.

416
00:44:43,852 --> 00:44:45,228
Oh!

417
00:44:45,951 --> 00:44:48,033
You don't like real girls.

418
00:44:51,189 --> 00:44:54,078
Well, I'm always here.

419
00:48:32,977 --> 00:48:34,684
Hi.

420
00:48:36,117 --> 00:48:37,772
You can't take those.

421
00:48:37,929 --> 00:48:41,245
Of course not. Proper channels
and paperwork. It's all here.

422
00:48:41,246 --> 00:48:42,771
Hold this for me.

423
00:48:44,599 --> 00:48:46,592
-Mmm. Yep. Here you go.
-Mmm.

424
00:49:03,810 --> 00:49:05,604
Coco is dead.

425
00:49:07,653 --> 00:49:09,546
Bones are gone.

426
00:49:10,174 --> 00:49:13,980
It's out. Already out.
How long'd that take?

427
00:49:14,681 --> 00:49:17,746
So, what do you have for me?
And don't say nothing.

428
00:49:18,547 --> 00:49:20,246
I found that.

429
00:49:20,959 --> 00:49:22,498
A sock?

430
00:49:24,443 --> 00:49:26,652
-Where'd you find it?
-Sapper's.

431
00:49:26,682 --> 00:49:28,524
Anything else?

432
00:49:28,525 --> 00:49:29,524
I burned everything else.

433
00:49:29,555 --> 00:49:32,668
Then what's this?
What's that date?

434
00:49:32,669 --> 00:49:33,668
Is that a birthday?
Is that a death day?

435
00:49:33,701 --> 00:49:35,437
I don't know yet.

436
00:49:38,902 --> 00:49:41,753
Am I the only one that can see
the fuckin' sunrise here?

437
00:49:41,800 --> 00:49:44,689
This breaks the world, "K."

438
00:49:57,083 --> 00:49:59,613
You know,
I've known a lot of your kind.

439
00:50:01,775 --> 00:50:06,515
All useful, but with you,
I sometimes forget.

440
00:50:07,243 --> 00:50:10,042
We didn't have any of you
where I was a kid.

441
00:50:15,649 --> 00:50:18,139
Do you remember anything?

442
00:50:18,716 --> 00:50:21,340
Before you were under me,

443
00:50:21,341 --> 00:50:22,340
you have any memories
from before?

444
00:50:22,404 --> 00:50:24,695
I have memories,

445
00:50:26,254 --> 00:50:28,778
but they're not real.
They're just implants.

446
00:50:29,967 --> 00:50:32,552
Tell me one.

447
00:50:32,553 --> 00:50:33,552
From when you were a kid.

448
00:50:38,274 --> 00:50:40,991
I feel a little strange
sharing a childhood story,

449
00:50:41,016 --> 00:50:43,131
considering
I was never a child.

450
00:50:45,121 --> 00:50:48,600
Well, would it help you share
if I told you it was an order?

451
00:50:51,252 --> 00:50:54,002
I have one
about a toy that I had.

452
00:50:54,065 --> 00:50:55,759
A wooden horse.

453
00:50:57,109 --> 00:50:59,174
With an inscription
underneath.

454
00:51:02,185 --> 00:51:05,068
All I remember
is a group of boys

455
00:51:05,069 --> 00:51:06,068
trying to take it away
from me.

456
00:51:06,546 --> 00:51:08,059
So I run.

457
00:51:33,121 --> 00:51:34,997
I go looking for a place
to hide it,

458
00:51:35,028 --> 00:51:37,497
and the only place
is this dark furnace.

459
00:51:39,112 --> 00:51:42,597
It's very dark
and I'm very scared,

460
00:51:42,795 --> 00:51:45,181
but this horse is all I have,

461
00:51:45,182 --> 00:51:46,181
so I go in anyway.

462
00:51:58,720 --> 00:52:00,491
Later on, those kids find me,

463
00:52:00,516 --> 00:52:04,120
and they beat me to tell 'em
where it is, but I don't.

464
00:52:10,335 --> 00:52:11,859
And that's it.

465
00:52:12,686 --> 00:52:14,022
Hmm.

466
00:52:14,408 --> 00:52:17,014
Little "K,"
fighting for what's his.

467
00:52:18,626 --> 00:52:20,336
It's a good one.

468
00:52:26,835 --> 00:52:28,339
Look at me.

469
00:52:30,709 --> 00:52:33,598
We're all just lookin' out
for somethin' real.

470
00:52:38,564 --> 00:52:40,901
What happens if I finish that?

471
00:52:44,654 --> 00:52:47,057
Shouldn't I get back
to work, madam?

472
00:52:56,359 --> 00:52:58,550
Check back in after DNAbase.

473
00:53:11,976 --> 00:53:14,750
Officer KD6-3.7.

474
00:53:17,597 --> 00:53:19,065
Request.

475
00:53:19,090 --> 00:53:22,785
DNA records:
children born 6-10-21.

476
00:53:23,124 --> 00:53:25,116
Looking for anomalies.

477
00:53:32,637 --> 00:53:34,408
You have
the satcrystal backup?

478
00:53:40,451 --> 00:53:42,034
Okay.

479
00:53:42,035 --> 00:53:43,034
Run it raw.

480
00:54:19,957 --> 00:54:22,049
Mere data makes a man.

481
00:54:23,929 --> 00:54:26,519
A and C and T and G.

482
00:54:26,953 --> 00:54:30,907
The alphabet of you.
All from four symbols.

483
00:54:32,450 --> 00:54:34,115
I'm only two:

484
00:54:37,510 --> 00:54:39,105
1 and 0.

485
00:54:39,395 --> 00:54:42,987
Half as much but twice
as elegant, sweetheart.

486
00:54:44,026 --> 00:54:46,118
You don't prefer your madam?

487
00:54:48,599 --> 00:54:50,230
You were listening.

488
00:54:51,156 --> 00:54:52,651
Maybe.

489
00:54:54,401 --> 00:54:57,297
You didn't like her enough
to tell her the truth.

490
00:54:57,979 --> 00:55:00,170
6, 10 and 21.

491
00:55:04,126 --> 00:55:06,118
There's nothin' to tell.

492
00:55:06,518 --> 00:55:09,626
How many times
have you told me that story?

493
00:55:11,729 --> 00:55:13,622
Your memory?

494
00:55:14,600 --> 00:55:16,875
The date carved beneath.

495
00:55:17,188 --> 00:55:19,426
6, 10 and 21.

496
00:55:21,329 --> 00:55:23,168
Coincidence?

497
00:55:27,141 --> 00:55:29,532
A dangerous coincidence.

498
00:55:33,031 --> 00:55:35,621
I always knew
you were special.

499
00:55:36,965 --> 00:55:38,996
Maybe this is how.

500
00:55:44,062 --> 00:55:45,733
A child.

501
00:55:46,252 --> 00:55:48,643
Of woman born.

502
00:55:49,752 --> 00:55:52,142
Pushed into the world.

503
00:55:53,219 --> 00:55:54,980
Wanted.

504
00:55:56,006 --> 00:55:57,601
Loved.

505
00:56:00,432 --> 00:56:02,623
Well, if it were true,

506
00:56:03,802 --> 00:56:06,482
I'd be hunted
for the rest of my life

507
00:56:06,483 --> 00:56:07,482
by someone just like me.

508
00:56:09,444 --> 00:56:11,735
It's okay to dream a little.

509
00:56:12,404 --> 00:56:13,927
Isn't it?

510
00:56:14,458 --> 00:56:16,240
Not if you're us.

511
00:56:21,439 --> 00:56:22,953
Stop.

512
00:56:23,582 --> 00:56:27,046
Put up 4847
and 2181, side-by-side.

513
00:56:32,933 --> 00:56:37,124
They're identical. Translate.

514
00:56:39,201 --> 00:56:41,094
A boy and a girl.

515
00:56:42,526 --> 00:56:44,133
It's impossible.

516
00:56:44,976 --> 00:56:46,422
Why?

517
00:56:47,019 --> 00:56:49,829
Two people
can't have identical DNA.

518
00:56:51,375 --> 00:56:55,218
One of these isn't real.
It's a copy.

519
00:56:59,983 --> 00:57:03,568
They were both processed
at the Morrill Cole Orphanage.

520
00:57:05,354 --> 00:57:07,545
It says the girl died there.

521
00:57:07,725 --> 00:57:09,618
Genetic disorder.

522
00:57:10,704 --> 00:57:12,597
Galatians Syndrome.

523
00:57:13,253 --> 00:57:15,017
And the boy...

524
00:57:16,982 --> 00:57:18,603
...disappears.

525
00:57:20,704 --> 00:57:22,597
Where's the orphanage?

526
00:57:24,921 --> 00:57:26,861
You wanna go for a ride?

527
00:58:42,840 --> 00:58:44,972
Well, here we are.

528
00:58:58,100 --> 00:58:59,803
Buckle up.

529
00:59:58,848 --> 01:00:00,491
"K"?

530
01:00:52,124 --> 01:00:53,661
"K"? "K"?

531
01:00:55,466 --> 01:00:57,067
"K"? "K"? "K"? "K"? "K"?

532
01:01:50,443 --> 01:01:52,137
Stay back.

533
01:02:07,260 --> 01:02:08,729
Fire again.

534
01:02:09,111 --> 01:02:10,667
Fire again.

535
01:02:12,381 --> 01:02:13,883
Fire.

536
01:02:24,882 --> 01:02:27,173
200 feet to the east.

537
01:02:29,062 --> 01:02:30,541
Fire.

538
01:02:32,347 --> 01:02:33,916
Go north.

539
01:02:35,882 --> 01:02:37,434
Fire.

540
01:02:38,120 --> 01:02:41,107
Stop. 20 degrees east.

541
01:02:42,897 --> 01:02:44,292
Stop.

542
01:02:44,589 --> 01:02:46,167
Zoom in.

543
01:02:47,506 --> 01:02:49,042
Closer.

544
01:02:52,253 --> 01:02:54,376
Oh, come on.

545
01:02:55,347 --> 01:02:56,853
Get up.

546
01:02:57,253 --> 01:02:59,064
Do your fucking job.

547
01:03:00,254 --> 01:03:02,048
Find the child.

548
01:03:38,039 --> 01:03:39,633
Watch the car.

549
01:05:18,319 --> 01:05:19,780
Every last piece,

550
01:05:19,805 --> 01:05:22,613
or I'll put you outside
where the sky is raining,

551
01:05:22,638 --> 01:05:24,630
where it's raining fire!

552
01:05:24,837 --> 01:05:26,554
You're in here to work.

553
01:05:26,585 --> 01:05:29,976
And if you're not working,
I don't need you.

554
01:05:30,073 --> 01:05:32,065
I don't need any of...

555
01:05:34,644 --> 01:05:36,152
Hi.

556
01:05:42,629 --> 01:05:45,491
The nickel
is for the colonial ships.

557
01:05:45,540 --> 01:05:47,919
Closest any of them
or any of us is gonna get

558
01:05:47,944 --> 01:05:51,356
to that grand life
off-world.

559
01:05:52,429 --> 01:05:54,984
And I encourage play, I do.

560
01:05:54,985 --> 01:05:55,984
Keeps 'em occupied and it
makes 'em nimble, right?

561
01:05:56,083 --> 01:05:58,474
But it's work.

562
01:05:59,277 --> 01:06:01,070
It's work that molds them
into a child worth havin'.

563
01:06:01,566 --> 01:06:05,051
So come on, now.

564
01:06:13,709 --> 01:06:15,203
What sort do you have in mind?

565
01:06:16,662 --> 01:06:18,655
'Cause I got all kinds.

566
01:06:22,166 --> 01:06:25,246
-Oh, no, no, no.
-I'm not buyin'.

567
01:06:27,795 --> 01:06:29,741
No, no, no.
This is just my game,

568
01:06:29,774 --> 01:06:32,857
and I play it fair.

569
01:06:32,881 --> 01:06:34,623
No. No, I mean,
bigger than you...

570
01:06:34,809 --> 01:06:36,602
Bigger than you
have tried to shut me down.

571
01:06:38,714 --> 01:06:41,033
Bigger than you.

572
01:06:41,058 --> 01:06:43,221
And they were men, at that.

573
01:06:43,354 --> 01:06:45,416
A little boy came through here
about 30 years back.

574
01:06:47,450 --> 01:06:50,637
-I need to see your records.
-Hmm.

575
01:06:51,033 --> 01:06:53,125
Legitimate placements,
private sales, everything.

576
01:06:54,179 --> 01:06:57,067
Don't keep records
that far back.

577
01:06:57,141 --> 01:06:59,232
-You don't?
-I don't.

578
01:06:59,257 --> 01:07:01,150
Sorry.

579
01:07:03,215 --> 01:07:05,269
Can't help you.

580
01:07:05,270 --> 01:07:06,269
- You can't?
- Nope.

581
01:07:09,745 --> 01:07:11,638
I think you can.

582
01:07:16,215 --> 01:07:17,893
I think someone like you
keeps a long memory.

583
01:07:20,003 --> 01:07:22,949
Now you can tell me
what you remember,

584
01:07:22,974 --> 01:07:24,959
or I can put a hole right here
and take a look.

585
01:07:24,984 --> 01:07:28,060
They were laughin'
and what was it you said?

586
01:07:41,707 --> 01:07:44,554
What did you say?

587
01:08:03,357 --> 01:08:05,116
Are you comin'?

588
01:08:15,784 --> 01:08:17,376
Where is it?

589
01:08:20,449 --> 01:08:21,930
Oh, God.

590
01:08:27,120 --> 01:08:28,814
Where, where, where, where?

591
01:08:31,131 --> 01:08:33,387
I don't see it. Here.

592
01:08:42,248 --> 01:08:43,817
It's gone.

593
01:08:45,936 --> 01:08:48,526
It's the entire year.

594
01:08:50,074 --> 01:08:51,768
I didn't do that.

595
01:08:52,455 --> 01:08:53,984
That wasn't me.

596
01:08:57,488 --> 01:09:01,278
I didn't. Wasn't me.

597
01:13:34,640 --> 01:13:37,518
I always told you.

598
01:13:37,519 --> 01:13:38,519
You're special.

599
01:13:42,722 --> 01:13:44,825
Born.

600
01:13:44,826 --> 01:13:45,825
Not made.

601
01:13:49,852 --> 01:13:51,696
Hidden with care.

602
01:13:55,044 --> 01:13:57,136
A real boy now.

603
01:13:59,722 --> 01:14:02,112
A real boy needs a real name.

604
01:14:03,511 --> 01:14:05,088
Joe.

605
01:14:06,689 --> 01:14:08,189
"Joe"?

606
01:14:08,244 --> 01:14:10,572
You're too important for "K."

607
01:14:11,367 --> 01:14:13,641
Your mother
would've named you.

608
01:14:16,542 --> 01:14:17,970
Joe.

609
01:14:20,125 --> 01:14:22,317
-Joe.
-Stop.

610
01:14:28,863 --> 01:14:31,874
How do I know if a memory
is an implant or not?

611
01:14:35,600 --> 01:14:37,559
Who makes the memories?

612
01:15:09,096 --> 01:15:10,989
Dr. Ana Stelline?

613
01:15:14,769 --> 01:15:16,276
A visitor.

614
01:15:18,751 --> 01:15:20,229
Is that okay?

615
01:15:20,940 --> 01:15:22,457
Yes.

616
01:15:24,125 --> 01:15:26,018
It's just unusual.

617
01:15:27,609 --> 01:15:32,090
Nice to meet you,
Officer KD6-3.7.

618
01:15:36,268 --> 01:15:40,052
Sorry. It's a compromised
immune system.

619
01:15:40,548 --> 01:15:44,531
A life of freedom,
so long as it's behind glass.

620
01:15:44,892 --> 01:15:46,861
Is that why
you're not off-world?

621
01:15:46,896 --> 01:15:48,376
Yes.

622
01:15:48,449 --> 01:15:52,345
My parents had our passes
in pocket, but I took sick.

623
01:15:52,783 --> 01:15:57,554
So it was a new life for me.

624
01:15:57,867 --> 01:16:01,338
And they put me in my cage,

625
01:16:01,385 --> 01:16:04,642
filled it with everything
they could to keep me happy.

626
01:16:04,690 --> 01:16:09,228
Except company, of course.
And I was used to crowds.

627
01:16:12,498 --> 01:16:14,626
What can I help you with?

628
01:16:15,284 --> 01:16:18,294
Thought you might be able
to help me with a case.

629
01:16:19,222 --> 01:16:23,932
Oh, that's the most
interesting thing

630
01:16:23,933 --> 01:16:24,932
I've been offered
to help with in ages.

631
01:16:26,034 --> 01:16:29,420
Do you mind if I work
while you talk?

632
01:16:30,254 --> 01:16:31,761
Of course.

633
01:16:38,476 --> 01:16:40,966
I promise
I hear every word.

634
01:16:47,932 --> 01:16:50,917
They say you're the best
memory-maker there is.

635
01:16:51,018 --> 01:16:53,110
Well, then, they're kind.

636
01:16:54,302 --> 01:16:56,594
I love birthday parties.

637
01:17:00,258 --> 01:17:02,095
You work for Wallace.

638
01:17:02,464 --> 01:17:05,869
Subcontract.
I'm one of his suppliers.

639
01:17:06,316 --> 01:17:09,517
He offered to buy me out,

640
01:17:09,518 --> 01:17:10,517
but I take my freedom
where I can find it.

641
01:17:11,820 --> 01:17:13,514
Why are you so good?

642
01:17:14,109 --> 01:17:16,994
What makes your memories
so authentic?

643
01:17:17,066 --> 01:17:20,979
Well, there's a bit of
every artist in their work.

644
01:17:21,674 --> 01:17:25,557
But I was locked
in a sterile chamber at 8,

645
01:17:26,396 --> 01:17:28,840
so if I wanted to see
the world,

646
01:17:28,841 --> 01:17:29,840
I had to imagine it.

647
01:17:31,428 --> 01:17:34,270
Got very good at imagining.

648
01:17:35,907 --> 01:17:39,354
Wallace needs my talent
to maintain a stable product.

649
01:17:40,784 --> 01:17:42,975
I think it's only kind.

650
01:17:44,466 --> 01:17:46,755
Replicants live
such hard lives,

651
01:17:46,810 --> 01:17:49,879
made to do
what we'd rather not.

652
01:17:50,409 --> 01:17:52,042
I can't help your future,

653
01:17:52,075 --> 01:17:55,047
but I can give you
good memories

654
01:17:55,048 --> 01:17:56,047
to think back on and smile.

655
01:17:57,007 --> 01:17:58,831
It's nice.

656
01:17:58,832 --> 01:18:01,375
It's better than nice.
It feels authentic.

657
01:18:01,420 --> 01:18:04,328
And if you have
authentic memories,

658
01:18:04,714 --> 01:18:06,906
you have real human responses.

659
01:18:07,889 --> 01:18:09,574
Wouldn't you agree?

660
01:18:17,773 --> 01:18:19,761
Are they all constructed

661
01:18:20,163 --> 01:18:22,762
or do you ever use
ones that are real?

662
01:18:26,311 --> 01:18:29,420
It's illegal to use
real memories, officer.

663
01:18:31,431 --> 01:18:33,564
How can you tell
the difference?

664
01:18:33,606 --> 01:18:35,598
Can you tell if something

665
01:18:37,173 --> 01:18:38,795
really happened?

666
01:18:40,795 --> 01:18:43,086
They all think
it's about more detail.

667
01:18:43,743 --> 01:18:46,134
But that's not how
memory works.

668
01:18:46,974 --> 01:18:49,066
We recall with our feelings.

669
01:18:49,362 --> 01:18:52,549
Anything real
should be a mess.

670
01:18:54,246 --> 01:18:56,040
I can show you.

671
01:18:57,539 --> 01:18:59,034
Sit.

672
01:19:17,277 --> 01:19:21,847
Now, think about the memory
you want me to see.

673
01:19:22,607 --> 01:19:25,097
Not even that hard.
Just picture it.

674
01:19:26,190 --> 01:19:27,788
Let it play.

675
01:20:17,748 --> 01:20:20,039
Someone lived this, yes.

676
01:20:21,629 --> 01:20:23,214
This happened.

677
01:20:39,944 --> 01:20:41,678
I know it's real.

678
01:20:53,182 --> 01:20:54,885
I know it's real.

679
01:20:57,901 --> 01:21:01,204
God damn it!

680
01:21:45,312 --> 01:21:48,918
Officer KD6-3.7.

681
01:21:48,919 --> 01:21:49,918
Madam is calling you in.

682
01:21:49,949 --> 01:21:51,769
You're under arrest.
Drop your gun

683
01:21:51,794 --> 01:21:54,123
and keep your hands
where I can see 'em.

684
01:21:54,892 --> 01:21:55,986
- Cells.
- Cells.

685
01:21:55,987 --> 01:21:57,777
Have you ever
been in an institution?

686
01:21:57,778 --> 01:21:58,972
-Cells.
-Cells.

687
01:21:58,973 --> 01:22:00,958
When you're not
performing your duties,

688
01:22:00,959 --> 01:22:01,958
do they keep you
in a little box?

689
01:22:01,959 --> 01:22:03,053
-Cells.
-Cells.

690
01:22:03,054 --> 01:22:04,446
- Interlinked.
- Interlinked.

691
01:22:04,447 --> 01:22:06,432
What's it like
to hold the hand

692
01:22:06,433 --> 01:22:07,432
of someone you love?
Interlinked.

693
01:22:07,483 --> 01:22:10,223
Interlinked.

694
01:22:10,319 --> 01:22:11,483
Within cells interlinked.

695
01:22:11,484 --> 01:22:12,483
Within cells interlinked.

696
01:22:12,510 --> 01:22:13,703
- Dreadfully.
- Dreadfully.

697
01:22:13,704 --> 01:22:15,693
What's it like to
be filled with dread?

698
01:22:15,694 --> 01:22:16,788
-Dreadfully.
- Dreadfully.

699
01:22:16,789 --> 01:22:18,878
Do you like being
separated from other people?

700
01:22:18,879 --> 01:22:19,973
-Distinct.
-Distinct.

701
01:22:19,974 --> 01:22:22,063
-Dreadfully distinct.
-Dreadfully distinct.

702
01:22:22,064 --> 01:22:23,158
-Dark.
-Dark.

703
01:22:23,159 --> 01:22:24,647
Within cells interlinked.

704
01:22:24,648 --> 01:22:25,647
Within the cells
interlinked.

705
01:22:25,648 --> 01:22:28,433
- Within one stem.
- Within one stem.

706
01:22:28,434 --> 01:22:29,723
And dreadfully distinct.

707
01:22:29,724 --> 01:22:30,723
And dreadfully distinct.

708
01:22:30,724 --> 01:22:32,315
- Against the dark.
- Against the dark.

709
01:22:32,340 --> 01:22:34,532
A tall white
fountain played.

710
01:22:35,302 --> 01:22:37,494
A tall white
fountain played.

711
01:22:39,919 --> 01:22:42,067
You're not even
close to baseline.

712
01:22:48,142 --> 01:22:50,035
Out! Close the door.

713
01:22:50,929 --> 01:22:53,021
What the fuck is with you?

714
01:22:53,226 --> 01:22:55,352
I put you on a case.

715
01:22:55,384 --> 01:22:57,813
I impressed on you
the importance of that case,

716
01:22:57,845 --> 01:23:00,610
and then we pick you up

717
01:23:00,611 --> 01:23:01,610
fucking around
outside an upgrade center?

718
01:23:03,027 --> 01:23:05,595
Scan said you didn't look like
you on the inside.

719
01:23:05,620 --> 01:23:07,574
Miles off your baseline.

720
01:23:07,605 --> 01:23:09,256
Do you know what that means?

721
01:23:09,281 --> 01:23:10,775
I found the kid.

722
01:23:15,431 --> 01:23:18,227
He was set up
like a standard Replicant,

723
01:23:18,228 --> 01:23:19,227
put on a service job.

724
01:23:21,555 --> 01:23:23,737
Even he didn't know
who he was.

725
01:23:25,742 --> 01:23:27,433
-And?
-And it's done.

726
01:23:27,458 --> 01:23:29,638
What does that mean,
"it's done"?

727
01:23:29,639 --> 01:23:30,638
What you asked.

728
01:23:32,036 --> 01:23:33,584
It's done.

729
01:23:41,392 --> 01:23:43,754
You just stopped a bomb
from goin' off.

730
01:23:45,328 --> 01:23:46,918
You did good.

731
01:23:49,127 --> 01:23:51,252
I can help you
get outta this station alive,

732
01:23:51,277 --> 01:23:54,066
but you have 48 hours
to get back on track.

733
01:23:54,331 --> 01:23:56,321
Surrender your gun and badge.

734
01:23:56,376 --> 01:23:59,563
And your next baseline test
is outta my hands.

735
01:24:01,406 --> 01:24:02,994
Thank you, madam.

736
01:24:35,040 --> 01:24:36,664
You were right.

737
01:24:43,401 --> 01:24:45,671
You were right
about everything.

738
01:24:46,281 --> 01:24:47,765
Shh.

739
01:25:14,057 --> 01:25:17,443
Thought you weren't
interested, worky man.

740
01:25:20,527 --> 01:25:22,619
You liked her. I could tell.

741
01:25:25,551 --> 01:25:27,067
It's okay.

742
01:25:27,793 --> 01:25:29,333
She's real.

743
01:25:31,476 --> 01:25:33,568
I wanna be real for you.

744
01:25:34,860 --> 01:25:36,901
You are real for me.

745
01:25:37,961 --> 01:25:40,053
You have a special lady here.

746
01:25:58,265 --> 01:25:59,737
Okay.

747
01:26:00,058 --> 01:26:01,577
Let's do it.

748
01:26:23,333 --> 01:26:24,869
Look at you.

749
01:26:25,124 --> 01:26:27,166
Quiet now,
I have to sync.

750
01:29:23,198 --> 01:29:26,485
Joi is
anything you want her to be.

751
01:29:28,515 --> 01:29:31,647
Joi goes anywhere
you want her to go.

752
01:30:01,640 --> 01:30:05,187
99.9% detoxified water.

753
01:30:34,952 --> 01:30:36,444
It's from a tree.

754
01:30:36,445 --> 01:30:38,141
I'm done with you.

755
01:30:39,064 --> 01:30:40,578
You can go now.

756
01:30:52,271 --> 01:30:53,728
Quiet, now.

757
01:30:54,361 --> 01:30:56,055
I've been inside you.

758
01:30:56,705 --> 01:30:59,096
Not so much there
as you think.

759
01:31:18,149 --> 01:31:19,621
Coffee?

760
01:31:25,446 --> 01:31:27,660
They'll be comin'
after me soon.

761
01:31:36,409 --> 01:31:38,070
I'm coming with you.

762
01:31:38,899 --> 01:31:40,523
But not like this.

763
01:31:41,108 --> 01:31:43,278
If they come here
looking for you,

764
01:31:43,303 --> 01:31:45,678
they'll have access
to all my memories.

765
01:31:46,454 --> 01:31:49,029
You have to delete me
from the console.

766
01:31:50,038 --> 01:31:51,578
My present.

767
01:31:53,598 --> 01:31:55,140
Put me there.

768
01:31:57,312 --> 01:31:59,006
I can't do that.

769
01:32:00,495 --> 01:32:02,164
Think about it.

770
01:32:03,039 --> 01:32:05,691
If anything happens to this,
that's it.

771
01:32:06,722 --> 01:32:08,238
You're gone.

772
01:32:08,414 --> 01:32:09,925
Yes.

773
01:32:11,069 --> 01:32:12,613
Like a real girl.

774
01:32:18,665 --> 01:32:20,147
Please.

775
01:32:23,244 --> 01:32:25,037
Joe, please.

776
01:32:26,130 --> 01:32:27,807
I want this.

777
01:32:31,711 --> 01:32:33,518
But I can't do it myself.

778
01:32:51,465 --> 01:32:53,094
Break the antenna.

779
01:33:33,339 --> 01:33:35,122
I don't need a real horse.

780
01:33:38,017 --> 01:33:40,317
I don't need a real horse.
I just...

781
01:33:40,880 --> 01:33:42,389
I just wanna find out
where it's from.

782
01:33:42,390 --> 01:33:43,389
Okay.

783
01:33:53,023 --> 01:33:54,813
Radiation from a reactor?

784
01:34:02,493 --> 01:34:04,570
It matches a dirty bomb.

785
01:34:12,531 --> 01:34:15,101
There's only one place
that dirty.

786
01:34:16,612 --> 01:34:18,281
Nobody lives there.

787
01:35:09,165 --> 01:35:10,765
- Go to five.

788
01:35:11,455 --> 01:35:13,796
Four, 30 degrees to the left.

789
01:35:16,156 --> 01:35:17,679
Tilt up.

790
01:35:20,244 --> 01:35:22,155
Elevate to 400 feet.

791
01:35:28,077 --> 01:35:30,069
Radiation analysis.

792
01:35:32,954 --> 01:35:34,508
Move forward.

793
01:35:41,315 --> 01:35:42,813
Tilt up.

794
01:35:43,206 --> 01:35:44,685
Stop.

795
01:35:46,590 --> 01:35:48,158
Move forward.

796
01:35:48,879 --> 01:35:50,392
Go to five.

797
01:35:51,543 --> 01:35:53,502
Seven, move forward.

798
01:35:58,687 --> 01:36:00,131
Six.

799
01:36:01,459 --> 01:36:02,943
Stop.

800
01:36:05,532 --> 01:36:07,116
Go to seven.

801
01:36:07,729 --> 01:36:09,156
Eight.

802
01:36:10,118 --> 01:36:11,585
Nine.

803
01:36:15,255 --> 01:36:16,765
Heat analysis.

804
01:36:24,847 --> 01:36:26,305
Life.

805
01:36:26,901 --> 01:36:28,456
What is it?

806
01:36:29,090 --> 01:36:31,237
Guess we're about to find out.

807
01:36:41,333 --> 01:36:43,027
Too dark in here.

808
01:36:46,097 --> 01:36:47,611
I like him.

809
01:36:48,545 --> 01:36:50,119
He's a good boy.

810
01:36:51,348 --> 01:36:52,873
Where is he?

811
01:36:59,197 --> 01:37:00,699
I have no idea. He's off-duty.

812
01:37:01,837 --> 01:37:04,723
Check around.

813
01:37:04,824 --> 01:37:06,411
I checked

814
01:37:07,609 --> 01:37:09,673
anywhere a good boy
might go.

815
01:37:10,427 --> 01:37:12,022
You're too late.

816
01:37:15,052 --> 01:37:16,719
It's gone.

817
01:37:19,708 --> 01:37:21,501
He destroyed it.

818
01:37:23,735 --> 01:37:25,892
Everything about it.

819
01:37:26,346 --> 01:37:28,821
Well, except
for the box of bones

820
01:37:28,822 --> 01:37:29,821
that you already took.

821
01:37:33,801 --> 01:37:37,288
Which, I'll wager,
wasn't enough. Here you are.

822
01:37:45,133 --> 01:37:47,026
You tiny thing.

823
01:37:48,682 --> 01:37:52,044
In the face
of the fabulous new,

824
01:37:52,045 --> 01:37:53,044
your only thought
is to kill it?

825
01:37:53,708 --> 01:37:56,138
For fear of great change?

826
01:37:57,177 --> 01:38:00,167
You can't hold the tide
with a broom.

827
01:38:00,661 --> 01:38:02,554
Except that I did.

828
01:38:03,846 --> 01:38:05,540
Where is he?

829
01:38:09,220 --> 01:38:11,014
You're so sure.

830
01:38:12,290 --> 01:38:14,282
Because he told you.

831
01:38:14,695 --> 01:38:16,735
Because we never lie.

832
01:38:18,468 --> 01:38:21,647
I'm gonna tell Mr. Wallace
you tried to shoot me first.

833
01:38:22,504 --> 01:38:24,381
So I had to kill you.

834
01:38:29,028 --> 01:38:31,190
Then do what you gotta do.

835
01:38:32,213 --> 01:38:33,752
Madam.

836
01:39:05,580 --> 01:39:08,757
Location: Officer KD6-3.7.

837
01:43:56,790 --> 01:44:02,152
"Mightn't happen to have

838
01:44:02,662 --> 01:44:04,166
"a piece of cheese
about you, now?"

839
01:44:19,233 --> 01:44:20,803
Would you, boy?

840
01:44:26,166 --> 01:44:27,400
Treasure Island?

841
01:44:27,664 --> 01:44:29,244
He reads.

842
01:44:30,333 --> 01:44:31,862
That's good.

843
01:44:32,821 --> 01:44:34,339
Me, too.

844
01:44:35,346 --> 01:44:38,533
Not much else to do
around here at night anymore.

845
01:44:41,281 --> 01:44:45,719
"Many is the night
I dream of cheese,

846
01:44:49,343 --> 01:44:52,569
"toasted, mostly."

847
01:44:55,912 --> 01:44:57,637
What are you doing here?

848
01:45:00,789 --> 01:45:02,483
I heard the piano.

849
01:45:04,395 --> 01:45:05,990
Don't lie.

850
01:45:07,122 --> 01:45:08,624
It's rude.

851
01:45:10,673 --> 01:45:12,466
You're a cop.

852
01:45:13,630 --> 01:45:16,482
-I'm not here to take you in.
-Oh, yeah?

853
01:45:19,295 --> 01:45:20,816
Then, what?

854
01:45:22,909 --> 01:45:25,101
I just have some questions.

855
01:45:25,673 --> 01:45:27,366
What questions?

856
01:45:45,153 --> 01:45:46,650
Stay.

857
01:48:19,732 --> 01:48:22,846
Look,
I don't wanna hurt you.

858
01:48:23,078 --> 01:48:25,071
But you're not makin' it easy.

859
01:48:57,678 --> 01:49:02,858
â™ھ Like a river flows

860
01:49:02,859 --> 01:49:03,858
â™ھ Surely to the sea

861
01:49:04,811 --> 01:49:08,342
â™ھ Darling, so it goes

862
01:49:08,408 --> 01:49:13,468
â™ھ Some things are meant to be

863
01:49:14,200 --> 01:49:15,994
I like this song.

864
01:49:16,055 --> 01:49:19,862
â™ھ Take my hand

865
01:49:21,654 --> 01:49:26,472
â™ھ Take my whole life, too

866
01:49:26,529 --> 01:49:29,566
We could keep at this,
or we could get a drink.

867
01:49:29,590 --> 01:49:34,663
â™ھ For I can't help

868
01:49:35,085 --> 01:49:41,552
â™ھ Falling in love with you â™ھ

869
01:49:42,163 --> 01:49:43,744
I'll take the drink.

870
01:49:52,122 --> 01:49:54,015
This is really somethin'.

871
01:49:54,260 --> 01:49:56,053
The whole town
was somethin'.

872
01:49:56,502 --> 01:49:58,030
One time.

873
01:49:59,985 --> 01:50:01,978
Forget your troubles,

874
01:50:03,071 --> 01:50:04,964
see a show,

875
01:50:06,584 --> 01:50:08,477
gamble a little.

876
01:50:11,041 --> 01:50:13,531
Win some money,
lose some money.

877
01:50:14,433 --> 01:50:17,722
They made money
seem like candy.

878
01:50:18,100 --> 01:50:19,691
You like whiskey?

879
01:50:20,227 --> 01:50:23,409
I've got millions

880
01:50:23,410 --> 01:50:24,409
of bottles of whiskey.

881
01:50:38,804 --> 01:50:40,297
Here.

882
01:50:41,093 --> 01:50:42,657
Bleeding.

883
01:50:55,326 --> 01:50:56,772
Is it real?

884
01:50:57,416 --> 01:50:58,911
I don't know.

885
01:50:59,063 --> 01:51:00,577
Ask him.

886
01:51:17,223 --> 01:51:18,719
Ya got a name?

887
01:51:20,669 --> 01:51:23,467
Officer KD6-3.7.

888
01:51:23,914 --> 01:51:25,923
That's not a name.
That's a serial number.

889
01:51:27,973 --> 01:51:29,448
All right.

890
01:51:31,955 --> 01:51:33,463
Joe.

891
01:51:33,608 --> 01:51:35,557
What do you want, Joe?

892
01:51:36,731 --> 01:51:39,828
- I wanna ask you some questions.
- Like what?

893
01:51:46,287 --> 01:51:48,130
Like, what was her name?

894
01:51:48,377 --> 01:51:50,138
The mother of your child.

895
01:51:57,267 --> 01:51:59,160
What was she like?

896
01:52:09,797 --> 01:52:11,468
Did you live here together?

897
01:52:11,469 --> 01:52:13,086
Too many questions.

898
01:52:14,355 --> 01:52:16,648
I had your job.
I was good at it.

899
01:52:16,695 --> 01:52:19,182
- It was simpler then.
- Why are you making it complicated?

900
01:52:19,215 --> 01:52:21,774
- Why don't you just answer the question?
- What question?

901
01:52:21,799 --> 01:52:24,687
I didn't figure you,
as one for bullshit.

902
01:52:25,273 --> 01:52:27,067
What's her name?

903
01:52:40,234 --> 01:52:41,670
Rachael.

904
01:52:46,520 --> 01:52:48,513
Her name was Rachael.

905
01:52:52,506 --> 01:52:54,411
What happened to the kid?

906
01:52:57,353 --> 01:53:00,059
Who put it in the orphanage?
Was it you?

907
01:53:02,828 --> 01:53:05,019
I was long gone, by then.

908
01:53:08,501 --> 01:53:10,831
You didn't even meet your own kid?

909
01:53:13,411 --> 01:53:14,885
Why?

910
01:53:15,698 --> 01:53:17,989
Because that was the plan.

911
01:53:20,095 --> 01:53:22,625
I showed them how to
scramble the records,

912
01:53:22,650 --> 01:53:24,321
cover their tracks.

913
01:53:25,300 --> 01:53:27,989
Everyone had a part.
Mine was to leave.

914
01:53:29,445 --> 01:53:32,104
Then the Blackout came,
baked over everything.

915
01:53:32,129 --> 01:53:34,507
Couldn't have found the child,
if I tried.

916
01:53:34,749 --> 01:53:36,332
Did you want to?

917
01:53:36,455 --> 01:53:38,941
- Not really.
- Why not?

918
01:53:39,034 --> 01:53:41,978
Because we were being hunted!

919
01:53:42,143 --> 01:53:44,689
I didn't want our child found.

920
01:53:44,930 --> 01:53:47,955
Taken apart. Dissected!

921
01:53:51,997 --> 01:53:54,841
Sometimes, to love someone...

922
01:53:56,973 --> 01:53:58,868
you gotta be a stranger.

923
01:54:20,105 --> 01:54:21,637
To strangers!

924
01:54:38,965 --> 01:54:42,403
â™ھ It's quarter to three,

925
01:54:42,691 --> 01:54:45,842
â™ھ there's no one in the place

926
01:54:46,436 --> 01:54:48,652
â™ھ except you and me

927
01:54:52,938 --> 01:54:55,521
So, set 'em up, Joe,

928
01:54:57,057 --> 01:54:59,677
â™ھ I got a little story...

929
01:55:02,191 --> 01:55:04,512
â™ھ you oughtta know

930
01:55:07,513 --> 01:55:10,253
â™ھ We're drinkin', my friend,

931
01:55:11,622 --> 01:55:13,409
â™ھ to the end

932
01:55:15,253 --> 01:55:18,321
â™ھ of a brief episode

933
01:55:21,365 --> 01:55:24,566
â™ھ Make it one for my baby

934
01:55:27,673 --> 01:55:30,103
â™ھ and one more for the road.

935
01:56:33,432 --> 01:56:34,961
What'd you do?

936
01:56:35,231 --> 01:56:37,025
Who'd you bring?

937
01:56:38,715 --> 01:56:41,211
- No one.
- Oh, yeah?

938
01:56:46,729 --> 01:56:48,606
Target locked.

939
01:56:50,627 --> 01:56:52,520
They know you're here.

940
01:56:53,744 --> 01:56:55,538
I came alone.

941
01:59:02,309 --> 01:59:03,909
Bad dog!

942
01:59:20,875 --> 01:59:22,406
Stop!

943
01:59:38,471 --> 01:59:41,125
I do hope you're satisfied
with our product.

944
01:59:41,687 --> 01:59:43,211
I love you.

945
02:02:56,940 --> 02:02:58,431
Hey.

946
02:02:58,931 --> 02:03:01,688
There's someone who wants
to meet you.

947
02:03:02,935 --> 02:03:04,629
You can trust us.

948
02:03:12,667 --> 02:03:15,644
You must want me to look up
and to the left.

949
02:03:21,426 --> 02:03:23,120
This is Freysa.

950
02:03:23,615 --> 02:03:25,924
She fought with Sapper on Calantha.

951
02:03:25,949 --> 02:03:27,581
I recognize you.

952
02:03:29,862 --> 02:03:32,234
Did you help him hide the child?

953
02:03:32,390 --> 02:03:33,757
Oh...

954
02:03:34,067 --> 02:03:35,773
I was there.

955
02:03:39,394 --> 02:03:41,586
I saw a miracle delivered.

956
02:03:42,825 --> 02:03:46,112
A perfect little face crying up at me.

957
02:03:46,707 --> 02:03:48,600
Mad as thunder.

958
02:04:02,035 --> 02:04:03,662
Were you with her?...

959
02:04:05,519 --> 02:04:07,002
Rachael?

960
02:04:07,126 --> 02:04:09,119
I held her as she died.

961
02:04:10,718 --> 02:04:12,279
We hid the child,

962
02:04:12,334 --> 02:04:15,068
and made a vow to keep our secret.

963
02:04:15,611 --> 02:04:18,101
That's why Sapper let you kill him.

964
02:04:19,308 --> 02:04:20,876
I knew...

965
02:04:21,008 --> 02:04:25,265
that baby meant we are more
than just slaves.

966
02:04:26,520 --> 02:04:29,110
If a baby can come from one of us,

967
02:04:29,377 --> 02:04:32,395
we are our own masters.

968
02:04:32,722 --> 02:04:35,113
"More human than humans".

969
02:04:37,239 --> 02:04:39,132
A revolution is coming.

970
02:04:39,476 --> 02:04:41,667
And we're building an army.

971
02:04:42,850 --> 02:04:45,042
I want to free our people.

972
02:04:53,494 --> 02:04:57,079
If you want to be free, join us.

973
02:05:02,423 --> 02:05:05,360
Deckard, Sapper, you, me;

974
02:05:05,385 --> 02:05:09,019
our lives mean nothing
next to a storm that's coming.

975
02:05:10,109 --> 02:05:14,499
Dying for the right cause is the
most human thing we can do.

976
02:05:17,454 --> 02:05:19,645
You led to Wallace to Deckard.

977
02:05:20,368 --> 02:05:24,244
You cannot allow Deckard
to lead Wallace to me.

978
02:05:24,831 --> 02:05:27,002
You must kill Deckard.

979
02:05:36,199 --> 02:05:39,088
Deckard only wanted
his baby to be safe.

980
02:05:39,836 --> 02:05:41,630
And she is.

981
02:05:43,531 --> 02:05:45,023
When the time comes,

982
02:05:45,055 --> 02:05:47,108
I will show her to the world.

983
02:05:47,142 --> 02:05:49,231
And se will lead our army.

984
02:05:49,278 --> 02:05:50,764
She?

985
02:05:50,947 --> 02:05:52,641
Of course.

986
02:05:53,015 --> 02:05:55,107
Rachael had a daughter.

987
02:05:56,299 --> 02:05:59,436
With my own eyes, I saw her come.

988
02:06:00,181 --> 02:06:03,357
I dressed her blue when
it was time for her to go.

989
02:06:03,382 --> 02:06:05,673
It was a boy that you hid.

990
02:06:07,500 --> 02:06:10,310
That is just a piece of the puzzle.

991
02:06:27,352 --> 02:06:29,650
You imagined it was you?

992
02:06:31,439 --> 02:06:32,798
Oh.

993
02:06:33,171 --> 02:06:34,689
You did.

994
02:06:35,317 --> 02:06:36,829
You did.

995
02:06:39,486 --> 02:06:41,578
We all wish it was us.

996
02:06:43,247 --> 02:06:45,140
That's why we believe.

997
02:07:01,676 --> 02:07:03,569
Someone lived this, yes.

998
02:07:05,972 --> 02:07:10,552
I showed them how to scramble
the records, cover their tracks.

999
02:07:10,650 --> 02:07:13,538
With my own eyes,
I saw her come.

1000
02:07:14,830 --> 02:07:18,515
I dressed her in blue when
it was time for her to go.

1001
02:07:19,256 --> 02:07:22,360
There's a bit of every
artist in their work.

1002
02:08:00,019 --> 02:08:02,111
Always jumping, that one.

1003
02:08:03,303 --> 02:08:06,463
Never a thought, what to do,
if it made land.

1004
02:08:07,590 --> 02:08:12,171
All the courage in the world
cannot alter fact.

1005
02:08:16,907 --> 02:08:22,085
I have wanted to meet you
for so very long.

1006
02:08:40,529 --> 02:08:43,118
You are a wonder to me,
Mr Deckard.

1007
02:08:49,027 --> 02:08:50,692
I had the lock.

1008
02:08:52,427 --> 02:08:54,618
I found the key.

1009
02:08:55,903 --> 02:09:00,406
Yet the pins do not align,
the door remains locked.

1010
02:09:03,122 --> 02:09:06,508
I need a specimen to reach it, Mr Deckard.

1011
02:09:10,289 --> 02:09:11,764
The child.

1012
02:09:13,175 --> 02:09:15,068
I need the child.

1013
02:09:16,261 --> 02:09:18,734
To teach them all to fly.

1014
02:09:27,186 --> 02:09:31,069
"And God remembered Rachel,

1015
02:09:33,082 --> 02:09:34,736
"He heeded her

1016
02:09:35,670 --> 02:09:37,563
"and opened her womb."

1017
02:09:38,280 --> 02:09:40,132
Do you like our owl?

1018
02:09:42,729 --> 02:09:44,576
It's artificial?

1019
02:09:45,524 --> 02:09:47,260
Of course it is.

1020
02:09:48,908 --> 02:09:50,721
Must be expensive.

1021
02:09:52,387 --> 02:09:53,840
Very.

1022
02:09:53,891 --> 02:09:55,585
I'm Rachael.

1023
02:09:56,074 --> 02:09:57,569
Deckard.

1024
02:10:09,526 --> 02:10:11,120
Is it the same,...

1025
02:10:12,597 --> 02:10:14,841
now as then,...

1026
02:10:17,673 --> 02:10:19,864
the moment you met her?

1027
02:10:29,617 --> 02:10:32,909
All these years you
looked back on that day,

1028
02:10:32,934 --> 02:10:35,980
drunk on the memory
of its perfection.

1029
02:10:39,271 --> 02:10:41,562
How shiny, her lips!

1030
02:10:41,667 --> 02:10:44,367
How instant, your connection!

1031
02:10:47,357 --> 02:10:49,093
Did it never occur to you,

1032
02:10:49,118 --> 02:10:52,342
that's why you were summoned
in the first place?

1033
02:10:53,792 --> 02:10:56,714
Designed to do nothing short of,
fall for her,

1034
02:10:56,739 --> 02:10:59,339
right then and there.

1035
02:11:01,609 --> 02:11:04,062
All to make that single,

1036
02:11:04,102 --> 02:11:05,593
perfect...

1037
02:11:05,640 --> 02:11:07,181
specimen.

1038
02:11:10,203 --> 02:11:12,992
That is, if you were designed.

1039
02:11:14,553 --> 02:11:16,061
Love,

1040
02:11:16,316 --> 02:11:19,104
or mathematical precision.

1041
02:11:24,730 --> 02:11:26,206
Yes?

1042
02:11:26,996 --> 02:11:28,503
No?

1043
02:11:32,987 --> 02:11:35,079
I know what's real.

1044
02:11:59,090 --> 02:12:02,473
It was very clever to keep
yourself empty of information.

1045
02:12:02,498 --> 02:12:06,083
And all it cost you was, everything.

1046
02:12:10,244 --> 02:12:12,535
But you can still help me.

1047
02:12:13,827 --> 02:12:17,014
You help help in the hiding.

1048
02:12:19,486 --> 02:12:21,359
Where did they go?

1049
02:12:23,077 --> 02:12:25,169
I know, you know something.

1050
02:12:26,217 --> 02:12:27,665
Help me...

1051
02:12:28,592 --> 02:12:32,144
and very, very good things
can come to you.

1052
02:12:37,815 --> 02:12:39,609
You don't have children.

1053
02:12:43,312 --> 02:12:44,708
Do you?

1054
02:12:45,181 --> 02:12:47,571
Oh, I have millions.

1055
02:12:49,959 --> 02:12:53,145
You think I have nothing to offer
but pain?

1056
02:12:53,441 --> 02:12:55,135
Only, I know...

1057
02:12:56,528 --> 02:12:58,122
you love pain.

1058
02:12:59,513 --> 02:13:03,950
Pain reminds you,
the joy you felt was real.

1059
02:13:05,974 --> 02:13:07,682
More joy, then!

1060
02:13:14,045 --> 02:13:16,037
Do not be afraid.

1061
02:13:30,873 --> 02:13:32,467
An angel...

1062
02:13:33,693 --> 02:13:35,586
made again.

1063
02:13:39,304 --> 02:13:40,831
For you.

1064
02:14:14,979 --> 02:14:16,695
Did you miss me?

1065
02:14:34,764 --> 02:14:36,525
Don't you love me?

1066
02:14:55,469 --> 02:14:57,168
Her eyes were green.

1067
02:15:14,680 --> 02:15:16,450
Off-world,...

1068
02:15:17,082 --> 02:15:20,070
I have everything I need
to make you talk.

1069
02:15:22,244 --> 02:15:24,635
You do not know what pain is, yet.

1070
02:15:26,524 --> 02:15:28,201
You will learn.

1071
02:15:40,159 --> 02:15:42,052
Hello handsome.

1072
02:15:58,871 --> 02:16:01,461
What day, hm?

1073
02:16:05,148 --> 02:16:07,041
You look lonely.

1074
02:16:08,128 --> 02:16:10,021
I can fix that.

1075
02:16:13,512 --> 02:16:16,337
You look like a good Joe.

1076
02:16:51,545 --> 02:16:56,863
Dying for the right cause is the
most human thing we can do.

1077
02:16:59,886 --> 02:17:02,277
Because you've
nevert seen a miracle.

1078
02:17:40,693 --> 02:17:44,065
You are entering Los Angeles Airport,
restricted airspace

1079
02:17:44,104 --> 02:17:45,624
Confirm your identity.

1080
02:17:45,649 --> 02:17:49,234
Transport S-14 Branch D, confirmed.

1081
02:17:49,616 --> 02:17:52,194
Base, this is 06 outbound...

1082
02:17:54,430 --> 02:17:56,124
Where are we going?

1083
02:17:57,117 --> 02:17:58,612
Home.

1084
02:18:53,639 --> 02:18:57,570
Drive 2 down.
Backup engaged.

1085
02:18:58,122 --> 02:18:59,569
Warning.

1086
02:18:59,594 --> 02:19:02,184
- Can we make it?
- We're too low!

1087
02:19:02,728 --> 02:19:04,312
Take us back!

1088
02:19:53,317 --> 02:19:54,886
Get us up!

1089
02:20:19,180 --> 02:20:20,759
Open the door.

1090
02:22:13,323 --> 02:22:15,055
I am the best one.

1091
02:22:55,972 --> 02:22:57,851
Off-world is waiting.

1092
02:25:11,048 --> 02:25:13,507
Joe. Joe!

1093
02:25:23,684 --> 02:25:25,201
Joe!

1094
02:26:04,331 --> 02:26:06,591
You should've let me die out there.

1095
02:26:07,562 --> 02:26:09,130
You did.

1096
02:26:12,890 --> 02:26:14,718
You drowned out there.

1097
02:26:20,439 --> 02:26:23,256
You're free to meet your daughter, now.

1098
02:27:47,785 --> 02:27:50,276
All the best memories are hers.

1099
02:27:59,400 --> 02:28:00,920
Why?

1100
02:28:03,473 --> 02:28:05,232
Who am I to you?

1101
02:28:14,427 --> 02:28:16,209
Go meet your daughter.

1102
02:28:22,369 --> 02:28:24,063
You OK?

1103
02:31:00,043 --> 02:31:01,645
Just a moment.

1104
02:31:04,124 --> 02:31:06,141
Beautiful, isn't it?
