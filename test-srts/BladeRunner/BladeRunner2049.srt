00:05:40,570 --> 00:05:43,530
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I hope you don't mind me
taking the liberty.</font>

3
00:05:46,370 --> 00:05:50,870
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I was careful not to drag in any dirt.</font>

4
00:05:51,830 --> 00:05:53,750
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't mind the dirt.</font>

5
00:05:55,460 --> 00:05:57,420
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I do mind...</font>

6
00:05:58,220 --> 00:06:00,350
<font face="Comic Sans MS">...unannounced visits.</font>

7
00:06:03,390 --> 00:06:04,440
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You police?</font>

8
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:11,150
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Are you Sapper Morton?
Civic number NK68514?</font>

9
00:06:11,310 --> 00:06:14,440
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- I'm a farmer.
- I saw that.</font>

10
00:06:15,610 --> 00:06:17,450
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What do you farm?</font>

11
00:06:24,660 --> 00:06:26,580
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's a protein farm.</font>

12
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:28,960
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wallace design.</font>

13
00:06:30,670 --> 00:06:31,920
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Is that what I smell?</font>

14
00:06:33,130 --> 00:06:35,220
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Grow that just for me.</font>

15
00:06:35,710 --> 00:06:36,870
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Garlic.</font>

16
00:06:37,050 --> 00:06:38,390
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Garlic.</font>

17
00:06:39,050 --> 00:06:40,970
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Go on, try some.</font>

18
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:43,520
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, thank you.</font>

19
00:06:45,220 --> 00:06:49,300
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I prefer to keep an empty stomach
until the hard part of the day is done.</font>

20
00:06:52,100 --> 00:06:53,770
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How long you been here?</font>

21
00:06:53,940 --> 00:06:56,070
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Since 2020.</font>

22
00:06:56,690 --> 00:06:59,560
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But you haven't always been a farmer,
have you?</font>

23
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:02,580
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Your bag.</font>

24
00:07:03,070 --> 00:07:04,860
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's colonial medical use.</font>

25
00:07:05,370 --> 00:07:07,290
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Military issue.</font>

26
00:07:09,450 --> 00:07:12,910
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Where were you? Calantha?</font>

27
00:07:16,630 --> 00:07:18,680
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Must have been brutal.</font>

28
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:21,140
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Plan on taking me in?</font>

29
00:07:22,220 --> 00:07:25,270
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Let them take a look inside?</font>

30
00:07:25,930 --> 00:07:27,730
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mr. Morton...</font>

31
00:07:28,390 --> 00:07:31,060
<font face="Comic Sans MS">...if taking you in is an option...</font>

32
00:07:35,100 --> 00:07:38,230
<font face="Comic Sans MS">...I would much prefer that
to the alternative.</font>

33
00:07:39,190 --> 00:07:42,150
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm sure you knew
it would be someone in time.</font>

34
00:07:44,110 --> 00:07:46,650
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm sorry it had to be me.</font>

35
00:07:49,910 --> 00:07:51,780
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Good as any.</font>

36
00:07:54,710 --> 00:07:57,550
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now, if you don't mind...</font>

37
00:07:59,130 --> 00:08:02,180
<font face="Comic Sans MS">...if you could just look up
and to the left, please.</font>

38
00:08:58,690 --> 00:08:59,820
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Please don't get up.</font>

39
00:09:11,780 --> 00:09:15,240
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How's it feel killing your own kind?</font>

40
00:09:18,830 --> 00:09:22,500
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't retire my own kind
because we don't run.</font>

41
00:09:24,090 --> 00:09:25,550
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Only older models do.</font>

42
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:30,520
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And you new models
are happy scraping the shit...</font>

43
00:09:35,140 --> 00:09:38,180
<font face="Comic Sans MS">...because you've never seen a miracle.</font>

44
00:10:19,060 --> 00:10:21,530
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Just photograph everything.</font>

45
00:10:32,740 --> 00:10:34,650
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Madam, please.</font>

46
00:10:34,830 --> 00:10:38,380
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Incoming L.A.P.D. re-codec hash.</font>

47
00:10:40,670 --> 00:10:42,800
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're hurt. I'm not paying for that.</font>

48
00:10:44,460 --> 00:10:45,790
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- I'll glue it.
- And?</font>

49
00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:54,520
<font face="Comic Sans MS">One of the tail-end Nexus 8s.</font>

50
00:10:54,680 --> 00:10:57,310
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He looks like he could take
your head off.</font>

51
00:10:57,470 --> 00:10:58,680
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He tried.</font>

52
00:10:58,850 --> 00:11:00,610
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He went AWOL after Calantha...</font>

53
00:11:00,770 --> 00:11:04,070
<font face="Comic Sans MS">...with a few more in his outfit
I wouldn't mind closing out.</font>

54
00:11:04,230 --> 00:11:06,110
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Just him?
- Just him.</font>

55
00:11:07,190 --> 00:11:09,440
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on home for your baseline.</font>

56
00:11:13,160 --> 00:11:14,410
<font face="Comic Sans MS">One moment, madam.</font>

57
00:12:02,750 --> 00:12:05,420
<font face="Comic Sans MS">30 meters to maximum depth.</font>

58
00:12:20,470 --> 00:12:21,510
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What is that?</font>

59
00:12:27,650 --> 00:12:28,820
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'll send a dig team.</font>

60
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:32,810
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on home before the storm.</font>

61
00:13:50,020 --> 00:13:52,680
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Officer KD6 -3.7.</font>

62
00:13:52,860 --> 00:13:56,030
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Let's begin. Ready?
- Yes, sir.</font>

63
00:13:56,990 --> 00:13:58,410
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Recite your baseline.</font>

64
00:13:58,570 --> 00:14:02,070
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And blood-black nothingness
began to spin.</font>

65
00:14:03,490 --> 00:14:06,120
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A system of cells interlinked
within cells...</font>

66
00:14:06,290 --> 00:14:09,340
<font face="Comic Sans MS">...interlinked within cells
interlinked within one stem.</font>

67
00:14:09,500 --> 00:14:11,630
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Fuck off, skin-job.</font>

68
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:18,180
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And dreadfully distinct against the dark,
a tall white fountain played.</font>

69
00:14:19,130 --> 00:14:20,170
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Cells.
- Cells.</font>

70
00:14:20,380 --> 00:14:23,300
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Have you ever been
in an institution? Cells.</font>

71
00:14:23,510 --> 00:14:25,720
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Do they keep you in a cell? Cells.
- Cells.</font>

72
00:14:25,890 --> 00:14:29,770
<font face="Comic Sans MS">When you're not performing your duties,
do they keep you in a little box? Cells.</font>

73
00:14:29,940 --> 00:14:31,650
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Interlinked.
- Interlinked.</font>

74
00:14:31,810 --> 00:14:34,980
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What's it like to hold the hand
of someone you love? Interlinked.</font>

75
00:14:35,150 --> 00:14:38,280
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Did they teach you how to feel
finger to finger? Interlinked.</font>

76
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:41,400
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Do you long for having
your heart interlinked? Interlinked.</font>

77
00:14:41,570 --> 00:14:43,940
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Do you dream about being interlinked?
- Interlinked.</font>

78
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:46,960
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What's it like to hold your child
in your arms? Interlinked.</font>

79
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:50,210
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Do you feel that there's a part of you
that's missing? Interlinked.</font>

80
00:14:50,370 --> 00:14:52,790
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Within cells interlinked.
- Within cells interlinked.</font>

81
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:55,170
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why don't you say that three times?</font>

82
00:14:55,340 --> 00:14:58,220
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Within cells interlinked.
Within cells interlinked.</font>

83
00:14:58,380 --> 00:15:01,050
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Within cells interlinked.</font>

84
00:15:03,260 --> 00:15:04,880
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We're done.</font>

85
00:15:06,220 --> 00:15:08,260
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Constant K.</font>

86
00:15:08,430 --> 00:15:10,640
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You can pick up your bonus.</font>

87
00:15:11,640 --> 00:15:12,930
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thank you, sir.</font>

88
00:15:13,100 --> 00:15:15,980
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Caution, keep clear.</font>

89
00:15:16,150 --> 00:15:17,820
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Caution, keep clear.</font>

00:15:19,530 --> 00:15:21,530

00:16:25,340 --> 00:16:28,920
<font face="Comic Sans MS">K? I didn't hear you. You're early.</font>

98
00:16:29,100 --> 00:16:31,060
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You want me to come back?</font>

99
00:16:31,220 --> 00:16:33,470
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Just go scrub.
- Yes, ma'am.</font>

100
00:16:35,230 --> 00:16:37,230
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How was your meeting?</font>

101
00:16:38,650 --> 00:16:40,490
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The usual.</font>

102
00:16:40,980 --> 00:16:42,810
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How was your day?</font>

103
00:16:44,030 --> 00:16:46,330
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm getting cabin fever.</font>

104
00:16:46,780 --> 00:16:50,900
<font face="Comic Sans MS">99.9 percent detoxified water.</font>

105
00:16:53,750 --> 00:16:58,670
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I had an accident at work.
I think I ruined my shirt.</font>

106
00:16:58,830 --> 00:17:02,960
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm sure I can fix that for you.
Let me take a look at it.</font>

107
00:17:08,890 --> 00:17:10,890
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I need a drink.</font>

108
00:17:11,470 --> 00:17:14,180
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Do you want a drink first?
- Pour me one, will you?</font>

109
00:17:16,770 --> 00:17:20,280
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm trying a new recipe.
I just need a bit more practice.</font>

110
00:17:20,440 --> 00:17:21,490
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Don't fuss.</font>

111
00:17:24,610 --> 00:17:29,230
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I should have marinated it longer.
I hope it isn't dry.</font>

112
00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:36,250
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Did you know this song was released
in 1966 on Reprise Records?</font>

113
00:17:36,410 --> 00:17:38,950
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It was number one on the charts.</font>

114
00:17:43,750 --> 00:17:47,960
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It won't be much longer.
Just putting on the finishing touches.</font>

115
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:55,480
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay, it's ready.
I hope you're gonna like it.</font>

116
00:17:55,640 --> 00:17:57,220
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I told you not to fuss.</font>

117
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:01,240
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And yet...</font>

118
00:18:03,820 --> 00:18:06,320
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Voila! Bon appetit.</font>

119
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:11,660
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I missed you, baby sweet.</font>

120
00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:14,750
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Honey, it's beautiful.</font>

121
00:18:15,330 --> 00:18:17,460
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Just put your feet up.</font>

122
00:18:17,870 --> 00:18:19,160
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Relax.</font>

123
00:18:37,680 --> 00:18:39,260
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Was a day?</font>

124
00:18:40,940 --> 00:18:42,860
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It was a day.</font>

125
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:44,570
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Would you read to me?</font>

126
00:18:46,650 --> 00:18:47,900
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It'll make you feel better.</font>

127
00:18:48,650 --> 00:18:50,820
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- You hate that book.
- I don't wanna read either.</font>

128
00:18:53,660 --> 00:18:54,710
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Let's dance.</font>

129
00:18:54,870 --> 00:18:57,370
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Do you wanna dance,
or do you wanna open your present?</font>

130
00:18:57,540 --> 00:18:59,130
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What present?</font>

131
00:19:03,170 --> 00:19:05,510
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- This one.
- What's the occasion?</font>

132
00:19:06,250 --> 00:19:08,420
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Let's just say...</font>

133
00:19:08,590 --> 00:19:10,970
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- ...it's our anniversary.
- Is it?</font>

134
00:19:12,890 --> 00:19:16,890
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, but let's just say that it is.</font>

135
00:19:17,850 --> 00:19:18,900
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay?</font>

136
00:19:22,940 --> 00:19:23,980
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Happy anniversary.</font>

137
00:19:25,820 --> 00:19:27,070
<font face="Comic Sans MS">An emanator.</font>

138
00:20:10,280 --> 00:20:11,410
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thank you.</font>

139
00:20:11,570 --> 00:20:15,990
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Honey, you can go anywhere you want
in the world now.</font>

140
00:20:16,820 --> 00:20:19,030
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Where do you wanna go first?</font>

141
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:35,210
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm so happy when I'm with you.</font>

142
00:22:37,590 --> 00:22:38,850
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You don't have to say that.</font>

143
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:14,260
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The dig's come through.
We have a new lead.</font>

144
00:23:14,420 --> 00:23:15,760
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Get down here.</font>

145
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:34,100

<font face="Comic Sans MS">Nothing else in it but hair.</font>

149
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:10,810
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The soil samples indicate
that she's been buried for 30 years.</font>

150
00:24:11,560 --> 00:24:15,610
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Bones all dismantled, fully cleaned,
meticulously laid to rest.</font>

151
00:24:15,770 --> 00:24:17,430
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"She"?</font>

152
00:24:18,570 --> 00:24:19,700
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Cause of death, Coco?</font>

153
00:24:31,080 --> 00:24:35,050
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No breaks, no sign of trauma, except...</font>

154
00:24:35,210 --> 00:24:38,300
<font face="Comic Sans MS">...a fracture through the ilium.</font>

155
00:24:38,790 --> 00:24:41,540
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's a narrow birth canal.
Baby must have got stuck.</font>

156
00:24:41,710 --> 00:24:43,790
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She was pregnant?</font>

157
00:24:44,970 --> 00:24:46,430
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So he didn't kill her?</font>

158
00:24:46,590 --> 00:24:47,920
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She died in childbirth.</font>

159
00:24:50,310 --> 00:24:51,810
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What's that?</font>

160
00:24:52,930 --> 00:24:54,510
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Go back.</font>

161
00:24:55,310 --> 00:24:56,810
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Closer.</font>

162
00:24:58,150 --> 00:24:59,780
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Closer.</font>

163
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:03,980
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What's that?</font>

164
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:10,960
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Notching in the iliac crest.</font>

165
00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:14,500
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's fine-point, like a scalpel.</font>

166
00:25:15,410 --> 00:25:18,370
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That looks like an emergency C-section.</font>

167
00:25:18,540 --> 00:25:22,210
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The cuts are clean.
No sign of a struggle.</font>

168
00:25:22,760 --> 00:25:27,430
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He was a combat medic. Maybe he tried
to save her, and he just couldn't.</font>

169
00:25:27,590 --> 00:25:29,970
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He didn't seem like the saving type.</font>

170
00:25:30,140 --> 00:25:32,230
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He went to the trouble of burying her.</font>

171
00:25:32,390 --> 00:25:33,900
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A sentimental skin-job.</font>

172
00:25:36,520 --> 00:25:38,030
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sorry.</font>

173
00:25:38,190 --> 00:25:40,650
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So where's the kid?</font>

174
00:25:41,610 --> 00:25:43,490
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You scan the whole field?</font>

175
00:25:43,650 --> 00:25:46,020
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Just dirt and worms. No other bodies.</font>

176
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:48,160
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Maybe he ate it.</font>

177
00:26:36,790 --> 00:26:38,710
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's not possible.</font>

178
00:26:41,170 --> 00:26:43,420
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She was a Replicant.</font>

179
00:26:45,670 --> 00:26:47,290
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Pregnant.</font>

180
00:26:56,390 --> 00:26:59,350
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The world is built on a wall.</font>

181
00:26:59,730 --> 00:27:01,900
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It separates kind.</font>

182
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:06,490
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Tell either side there's no wall,
you bought a war.</font>

183
00:27:06,650 --> 00:27:08,520
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Or a slaughter.</font>

184
00:27:12,110 --> 00:27:14,320
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So what you saw...</font>

185
00:27:16,120 --> 00:27:17,330
<font face="Comic Sans MS">...didn't happen.</font>

186
00:27:19,750 --> 00:27:21,090
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes, madam.</font>

187
00:27:21,250 --> 00:27:24,090
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It is my job to keep order.</font>

188
00:27:24,250 --> 00:27:27,370
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's what we do here. We keep order.</font>

189
00:27:28,920 --> 00:27:30,040
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You want it gone?</font>

190
00:27:32,090 --> 00:27:33,710
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Erase everything.</font>

191
00:27:33,890 --> 00:27:36,810
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Even the child?
- All trace.</font>

192
00:27:40,890 --> 00:27:43,310
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You have anything more to say?</font>

193
00:27:44,730 --> 00:27:47,980
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I've never retired something
that was born before.</font>

194
00:27:48,730 --> 00:27:50,730
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What's the difference?</font>

195
00:27:54,700 --> 00:27:57,000
<font face="Comic Sans MS">To be born is to have a soul, I guess.</font>

196
00:27:58,240 --> 00:27:59,490
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Are you telling me no?</font>

197
00:28:01,080 --> 00:28:03,080
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I wasn't aware
that was an option, madam.</font>

198
00:28:03,670 --> 00:28:05,300
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Attaboy.</font>

199
00:28:08,300 --> 00:28:12,100
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey. You've been getting on fine
without one.</font>

200
00:28:12,260 --> 00:28:13,310
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What's that, madam?</font>

201
00:28:14,340 --> 00:28:15,960
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A soul.</font>

202
00:29:02,730 --> 00:29:07,320
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And you new models
are happy scraping the shit...</font>

203
00:29:09,770 --> 00:29:12,860
<font face="Comic Sans MS">...because you've never seen a miracle.</font>

204
00:29:36,380 --> 00:29:39,340
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Just checking in on an old serial number.</font>

205
00:29:43,890 --> 00:29:45,430
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Confirmation DNA?</font>

206
00:29:46,770 --> 00:29:48,530
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I got hair.</font>

207
00:30:07,330 --> 00:30:09,160
<font face="Comic Sans MS">An old one.</font>

208
00:30:09,630 --> 00:30:11,550
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Pre-Blackout.</font>

209
00:30:12,670 --> 00:30:15,090
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's gonna be tough.</font>

210
00:30:15,800 --> 00:30:17,430
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Not much from then.</font>

211
00:30:17,590 --> 00:30:19,710
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And what's there is...</font>

212
00:30:20,050 --> 00:30:21,920
<font face="Comic Sans MS">...thick milky.</font>

213
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:25,520
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You can customize them
as much as you'd like.</font>

214
00:30:25,890 --> 00:30:28,430
<font face="Comic Sans MS">As human as you want them to be.</font>

215
00:30:28,810 --> 00:30:32,180
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But your operation is strictly
a drill site, isn't it?</font>

216
00:30:32,360 --> 00:30:37,030
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I wouldn't waste your money
on intelligence, attachment or appeal.</font>

217
00:30:37,490 --> 00:30:41,080
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Unless you'd like to add
some pleasure models to your order.</font>

218
00:30:54,500 --> 00:30:57,670
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Would it be possible
to reschedule this call, please?</font>

219
00:31:00,180 --> 00:31:03,520
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Everyone remembers where they were
at the Blackout. You?</font>

220
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:05,270
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That was a little before my time.</font>

221
00:31:06,270 --> 00:31:09,520
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I was home with my folks,
then 10 days of darkness.</font>

222
00:31:09,690 --> 00:31:11,230
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Every machine stopped cold.</font>

223
00:31:11,400 --> 00:31:13,610
<font face="Comic Sans MS">When the lights came back,
we were wiped clean.</font>

224
00:31:13,980 --> 00:31:19,400
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Photos, files, every bit of data, gone.
Bank records too.</font>

225
00:31:19,570 --> 00:31:20,730
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Didn't mind that.</font>

226
00:31:20,910 --> 00:31:22,950
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's funny it's only paper that lasted.</font>

227
00:31:23,120 --> 00:31:26,580
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I mean, we had everything on drives.
Everything, everything, everything.</font>

228
00:31:28,250 --> 00:31:30,750
<font face="Comic Sans MS">My mom still cries
over the lost baby pictures.</font>

229
00:31:31,540 --> 00:31:35,210
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, it's a shame.
You must have been adorable.</font>

230
00:31:41,130 --> 00:31:44,260
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Pretty fractured. Not much on it.</font>

231
00:31:44,760 --> 00:31:47,300
<font face="Comic Sans MS">One of the last gens, pre-Prohibition.</font>

232
00:31:47,470 --> 00:31:49,340
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Standard issue.</font>

233
00:31:49,520 --> 00:31:52,110
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Made by Tyrell.
- And?</font>

234
00:31:53,310 --> 00:31:54,930
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Unremarkable.</font>

235
00:31:55,110 --> 00:31:56,360
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"Unremarkable"?</font>

236
00:31:56,520 --> 00:31:59,360
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There must be something else
we can find for him.</font>

237
00:32:06,870 --> 00:32:09,630
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Another prodigal serial number returns.</font>

238
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:14,090
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A 30-year-old open case finally closed.</font>

239
00:32:14,500 --> 00:32:16,500
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thank you, officer.</font>

240
00:32:17,250 --> 00:32:19,210
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm here for Mr. Wallace. I'm Luv.</font>

241
00:32:21,800 --> 00:32:23,470
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He named you.</font>

242
00:32:24,180 --> 00:32:26,140
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Must be special.</font>

243
00:32:26,600 --> 00:32:28,350
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm here for Mr. Wallace.</font>

244
00:32:28,510 --> 00:32:30,090
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Follow me.</font>

245
00:32:35,900 --> 00:32:38,860
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The ancient models give
the entire endeavor a bad name.</font>

246
00:32:40,780 --> 00:32:44,950
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What a gift, don't you think,
from Mr. Wallace to the world?</font>

247
00:32:48,530 --> 00:32:52,160
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The outer colonies would never have
flourished had he not bought Tyrell...</font>

248
00:32:52,330 --> 00:32:54,920
<font face="Comic Sans MS">...revivified the technology.</font>

249
00:32:55,330 --> 00:32:57,750
<font face="Comic Sans MS">To say the least of what we do.</font>

250
00:33:07,680 --> 00:33:09,850
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I see you're also a customer.</font>

251
00:33:10,010 --> 00:33:12,550
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Are you satisfied with our product?</font>

252
00:33:12,730 --> 00:33:16,860
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She's very realistic. Thank you.</font>

253
00:33:17,310 --> 00:33:19,890
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Here. All the junk is in here.</font>

254
00:33:20,070 --> 00:33:23,240
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Lucky for you,
Mr. Wallace is a data hoarder.</font>

255
00:33:35,460 --> 00:33:37,800
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No one's been down here in ages.</font>

256
00:33:40,670 --> 00:33:42,510
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sorry about that.</font>

257
00:33:53,770 --> 00:33:58,360
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All our memory bearings from the time.
They were all damaged in the Blackout.</font>

258
00:33:58,810 --> 00:34:01,520
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But there are sometimes fragments.</font>

259
00:34:17,290 --> 00:34:21,090
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You got a little boy. He shows you his
butterfly collection, plus the killing jar.</font>

260
00:34:21,250 --> 00:34:23,290
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'd take him to the doctor.</font>

261
00:34:25,840 --> 00:34:28,310
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- There's a wasp crawling on your arm.
- I'd kill it.</font>

262
00:34:31,300 --> 00:34:35,140
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're reading a magazine. You come
across a full-page nude photo of a girl.</font>

263
00:34:35,310 --> 00:34:38,440
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Is this testing whether I'm a Replicant
or a lesbian, Mr. Deckard?</font>

264
00:34:38,600 --> 00:34:40,850
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Just answer the questions, please.</font>

265
00:34:44,360 --> 00:34:47,950
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It was unclear what she was,
at least to someone.</font>

266
00:34:48,110 --> 00:34:50,030
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This was a test.</font>

267
00:34:50,410 --> 00:34:52,710
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We were difficult to spot then.</font>

268
00:34:54,240 --> 00:34:57,320
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Was there anything unusual
about how you found her?</font>

269
00:34:57,790 --> 00:35:00,340
<font face="Comic Sans MS">To warrant an official investigation?</font>

270
00:35:02,710 --> 00:35:05,830
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know how people are
about old serial numbers.</font>

271
00:35:06,380 --> 00:35:10,250
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Everyone just sleeps better
when they know where they got to.</font>

272
00:35:12,720 --> 00:35:14,470
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She likes him.</font>

273
00:35:15,560 --> 00:35:16,940
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Who?</font>

274
00:35:17,310 --> 00:35:19,900
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This Officer Deckard.</font>

275
00:35:20,810 --> 00:35:23,020
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She's trying to provoke him.</font>

276
00:35:26,230 --> 00:35:29,730
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It is invigorating
being asked personal questions.</font>

277
00:35:29,900 --> 00:35:31,780
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Makes one feel...</font>

278
00:35:32,820 --> 00:35:34,570
<font face="Comic Sans MS">...desired.</font>

279
00:35:35,620 --> 00:35:38,080
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Do you enjoy your work, officer?</font>

280
00:35:42,250 --> 00:35:44,260
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Please thank Mr. Wallace for your time.</font>

281
00:35:56,930 --> 00:35:59,300
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You worked with Officer Deckard...</font>

282
00:35:59,480 --> 00:36:01,230
<font face="Comic Sans MS">...back in the day.</font>

283
00:36:01,390 --> 00:36:03,180
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What can you tell me about him?</font>

284
00:36:03,980 --> 00:36:06,240
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He liked to work alone.</font>

285
00:36:07,150 --> 00:36:08,990
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So did I.</font>

286
00:36:10,950 --> 00:36:14,450
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So we worked together
to keep it that way.</font>

287
00:36:15,410 --> 00:36:17,370
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That was it.</font>

288
00:36:17,950 --> 00:36:20,280
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Anything else you can tell me?</font>

289
00:36:21,870 --> 00:36:24,700
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He wasn't long for this world.</font>

290
00:36:26,250 --> 00:36:27,290
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How so?</font>

291
00:36:30,210 --> 00:36:32,800
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Something in his eyes.</font>

292
00:36:35,640 --> 00:36:37,770
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Any idea how I could contact him?</font>

293
00:36:38,560 --> 00:36:39,980
<font face="Comic Sans MS">None.</font>

294
00:36:41,480 --> 00:36:43,900
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He's nyugdijas.</font>

295
00:36:46,730 --> 00:36:47,850
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Retired.</font>

296
00:36:49,780 --> 00:36:51,030
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What happened?</font>

297
00:36:51,190 --> 00:36:53,980
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Probably got what he wanted.</font>

298
00:36:55,950 --> 00:36:57,330
<font face="Comic Sans MS">To be alone.</font>

299
00:37:22,680 --> 00:37:23,800
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Welcome back, sir.</font>

300
00:37:26,060 --> 00:37:29,480
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You wanted to review the new model,
sir, before shipment?</font>

301
00:37:30,690 --> 00:37:35,400
<font face="Comic Sans MS">An angel should never enter
the kingdom of heaven...</font>

302
00:37:35,570 --> 00:37:37,070
<font face="Comic Sans MS">...without a gift.</font>

303
00:37:39,700 --> 00:37:43,450
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Can you at least pronounce,
"A child is born"?</font>

304
00:37:54,090 --> 00:37:55,970
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A new model.</font>

305
00:38:03,470 --> 00:38:06,140
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, let us see her, then.</font>

306
00:38:54,190 --> 00:38:57,900
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The first thought...</font>

307
00:38:59,360 --> 00:39:01,860
<font face="Comic Sans MS">...one tends to fear...</font>

308
00:39:02,780 --> 00:39:04,820
<font face="Comic Sans MS">...to preserve the clay.</font>

309
00:39:07,370 --> 00:39:09,620
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's fascinating.</font>

310
00:39:10,290 --> 00:39:13,410
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Before we even know what we are...</font>

311
00:39:15,250 --> 00:39:17,380
<font face="Comic Sans MS">...we fear to lose it.</font>

312
00:39:18,760 --> 00:39:20,850
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Happy birthday.</font>

313
00:39:29,890 --> 00:39:31,770
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now, let's have a look at you.</font>

314
00:40:23,320 --> 00:40:25,820
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We make angels...</font>

315
00:40:26,870 --> 00:40:30,290
<font face="Comic Sans MS">...in the service of civilization.</font>

316
00:40:31,160 --> 00:40:33,950
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes, there were bad angels once.</font>

317
00:40:34,130 --> 00:40:36,590
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I make good angels now.</font>

318
00:40:36,750 --> 00:40:41,750
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That is how I took us
to 9 new worlds.</font>

319
00:40:43,930 --> 00:40:45,850
<font face="Comic Sans MS">9.</font>

320
00:40:47,050 --> 00:40:50,220
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A child can count to 9 on fingers.</font>

321
00:40:50,600 --> 00:40:53,360
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We should own the stars.</font>

322
00:40:53,520 --> 00:40:54,940
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes, sir.</font>

323
00:40:57,980 --> 00:41:02,690
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Every leap of civilization was built off
the back of a disposable workforce.</font>

324
00:41:02,860 --> 00:41:06,070
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We lost our stomach for slaves...</font>

325
00:41:06,240 --> 00:41:08,650
<font face="Comic Sans MS">...unless engineered.</font>

326
00:41:11,620 --> 00:41:14,200
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But I can only make so many.</font>

327
00:41:19,590 --> 00:41:21,640
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That barren pasture...</font>

328
00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:24,640
<font face="Comic Sans MS">...empty...</font>

329
00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:26,630
<font face="Comic Sans MS">...and salted...</font>

330
00:41:27,970 --> 00:41:29,720
<font face="Comic Sans MS">...right here.</font>

331
00:41:31,600 --> 00:41:34,570
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The dead space between the stars.</font>

332
00:41:36,810 --> 00:41:40,020
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And this, the seat
that we must change for heaven.</font>

333
00:41:45,150 --> 00:41:49,780
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I cannot breed them.
So help me, I have tried.</font>

334
00:41:50,450 --> 00:41:53,490
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We need more Replicants
than can ever be assembled.</font>

335
00:41:53,660 --> 00:41:57,700
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Millions, so we can be trillions more.</font>

336
00:41:59,170 --> 00:42:02,590
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We could storm Eden and retake her.</font>

337
00:42:14,520 --> 00:42:16,320
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Tyrell's final trick:</font>

338
00:42:17,520 --> 00:42:19,440
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Procreation.</font>

339
00:42:19,610 --> 00:42:22,860
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Perfected, then lost.</font>

340
00:42:24,070 --> 00:42:25,780
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But there is a child.</font>

341
00:42:29,120 --> 00:42:30,870
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Bring it to me.</font>

342
00:42:31,330 --> 00:42:32,790
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sir.</font>

343
00:42:40,880 --> 00:42:43,470
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The best angel of all.</font>

344
00:42:44,510 --> 00:42:46,510
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Aren't you, Luv?</font>

345
00:44:04,090 --> 00:44:05,840
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The man with the green jacket.</font>

346
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:09,880
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The one who killed Sapper.
Find out what he knows.</font>

347
00:44:28,860 --> 00:44:30,370
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hi.</font>

348
00:44:31,400 --> 00:44:33,650
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hello, hello, A-Boy.</font>

349
00:44:33,820 --> 00:44:35,650
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You alone?</font>

350
00:44:42,750 --> 00:44:44,250
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's fine.</font>

351
00:44:50,130 --> 00:44:51,500
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wanna buy a lady a cigarette?</font>

352
00:44:58,890 --> 00:45:00,190
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, you don't even smile.</font>

353
00:45:03,390 --> 00:45:05,560
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Didn't you hear your friends?</font>

354
00:45:05,730 --> 00:45:07,570
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Don't you know what I am?</font>

355
00:45:07,730 --> 00:45:09,480
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah.</font>

356
00:45:09,650 --> 00:45:11,770
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Guy eating rice.</font>

357
00:45:12,780 --> 00:45:14,450
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What's that?</font>

358
00:45:15,360 --> 00:45:16,400
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's a tree.</font>

359
00:45:18,370 --> 00:45:20,790
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Never seen a tree before.</font>

360
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:23,670
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's pretty.</font>

361
00:45:25,500 --> 00:45:27,340
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's dead.</font>

362
00:45:28,710 --> 00:45:33,590
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now, who keeps a dead tree?</font>

363
00:45:40,430 --> 00:45:42,340
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're not gonna kill me, are you?</font>

364
00:45:42,520 --> 00:45:45,150
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Depends. What's your model number?</font>

365
00:45:45,770 --> 00:45:47,820
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why don't you look under my eye
and find out?</font>

366
00:45:53,070 --> 00:45:55,410
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You don't like real girls.</font>

367
00:45:58,280 --> 00:46:01,360
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, I'm always here.</font>

368
00:49:39,670 --> 00:49:40,710
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hi.</font>

369
00:49:43,380 --> 00:49:45,130
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You can't take those.</font>

370
00:49:45,300 --> 00:49:48,420
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Of course not. Proper channels
and paperwork. It's all here.</font>

371
00:49:48,600 --> 00:49:50,310
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hold this for me.</font>

372
00:49:51,890 --> 00:49:54,050
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yep. Here you go.</font>

373
00:50:11,160 --> 00:50:13,070
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Coco is dead.</font>

374
00:50:15,040 --> 00:50:16,340
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Bones are gone.</font>

375
00:50:17,500 --> 00:50:20,670
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's out. Already out.
How long did that take?</font>

376
00:50:22,090 --> 00:50:25,050
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So, what do you have for me?
And don't say nothing.</font>

377
00:50:25,970 --> 00:50:27,640
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I found that.</font>

378
00:50:28,340 --> 00:50:29,920
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A sock?</font>

379
00:50:31,810 --> 00:50:33,850
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Where'd you find it?
- Sapper's.</font>

380
00:50:34,020 --> 00:50:35,110
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Anything else?</font>

381
00:50:35,690 --> 00:50:37,520
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I burned everything else.</font>

382
00:50:37,690 --> 00:50:40,940
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Then what's this? What's that date?
Is that a birthday? A death day?</font>

383
00:50:41,110 --> 00:50:42,780
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't know yet.</font>

384
00:50:46,400 --> 00:50:48,980
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Am I the only one that can see
the fucking sunrise here?</font>

385
00:50:49,160 --> 00:50:51,250
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This breaks the world, K.</font>

386
00:51:04,550 --> 00:51:07,220
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know, I've known a lot of your kind.</font>

387
00:51:09,260 --> 00:51:14,060
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All useful, but with you,
I sometimes forget.</font>

388
00:51:14,640 --> 00:51:17,550
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We didn't have any of you
where I was a kid.</font>

389
00:51:23,020 --> 00:51:24,730
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Do you remember anything?</font>

390
00:51:26,190 --> 00:51:29,610
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Before you were under me,
you have any memories from before?</font>

391
00:51:29,780 --> 00:51:31,990
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I have memories...</font>

392
00:51:33,700 --> 00:51:36,490
<font face="Comic Sans MS">...but they're not real.
They're just implants.</font>

393
00:51:37,370 --> 00:51:39,080
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Tell me one.</font>

394
00:51:39,500 --> 00:51:41,510
<font face="Comic Sans MS">From when you were a kid.</font>

395
00:51:45,760 --> 00:51:49,850
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I feel strange sharing a childhood story,
considering I was never a child.</font>

396
00:51:52,550 --> 00:51:56,470
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, would it help you share
if I told you it was an order?</font>

397
00:51:58,680 --> 00:52:01,350
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I have one about a toy that I had.</font>

398
00:52:01,520 --> 00:52:03,600
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A wooden horse.</font>

399
00:52:04,610 --> 00:52:07,160
<font face="Comic Sans MS">With an inscription underneath.</font>

400
00:52:09,650 --> 00:52:13,780
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All I remember is a group of boys
trying to take it away from me.</font>

401
00:52:13,950 --> 00:52:15,120
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So I run.</font>

402
00:52:40,730 --> 00:52:44,440
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I go looking for a place to hide it,
and the only place is this dark furnace.</font>

403
00:52:46,690 --> 00:52:50,110
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's very dark, and I'm very scared...</font>

404
00:52:50,280 --> 00:52:53,870
<font face="Comic Sans MS">...but this horse is all I have,
so I go in anyway.</font>

405
00:53:06,250 --> 00:53:08,330
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Later on, those kids find me...</font>

406
00:53:08,500 --> 00:53:11,170
<font face="Comic Sans MS">...and they beat me to tell them
where it is, but I don't.</font>

407
00:53:17,890 --> 00:53:19,560
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's it.</font>

408
00:53:21,930 --> 00:53:25,100
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Little K, fighting for what's his.</font>

409
00:53:26,270 --> 00:53:28,020
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's a good one.</font>

410
00:53:34,200 --> 00:53:35,240
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Look at me.</font>

411
00:53:38,280 --> 00:53:41,320
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We're all just looking out
for something real.</font>

412
00:53:46,210 --> 00:53:48,720
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What happens if I finish that?</font>

413
00:53:52,170 --> 00:53:53,840
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Shouldn't I get back to work, madam?</font>

414
00:54:03,940 --> 00:54:06,610
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Check back in after DNA base.</font>

415
00:54:19,620 --> 00:54:22,170
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Officer KD6 -3.7.</font>

416
00:54:25,040 --> 00:54:26,380
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Request.</font>

417
00:54:26,540 --> 00:54:30,540
<font face="Comic Sans MS">DNA records: children born 6-10-21.</font>

418
00:54:30,710 --> 00:54:32,750
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Looking for anomalies.</font>

419
00:54:40,220 --> 00:54:41,720
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You have the satcrystal backup?</font>

420
00:54:48,060 --> 00:54:49,100
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay.</font>

421
00:54:49,560 --> 00:54:51,520
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Run it raw.</font>

422
00:55:27,730 --> 00:55:30,360
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mere data makes a man.</font>

423
00:55:31,730 --> 00:55:33,890
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A and C and T and G.</font>

424
00:55:34,650 --> 00:55:38,940
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The alphabet of you.
All from four symbols.</font>

425
00:55:40,070 --> 00:55:41,610
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm only two:</font>

426
00:55:45,200 --> 00:55:46,870
<font face="Comic Sans MS">One and zero.</font>

427
00:55:47,040 --> 00:55:50,550
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Half as much but twice as elegant,
sweetheart.</font>

428
00:55:51,710 --> 00:55:53,920
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You don't prefer your madam?</font>

429
00:55:56,260 --> 00:55:58,220
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You were listening.</font>

430
00:55:58,840 --> 00:56:00,550
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Maybe.</font>

431
00:56:02,140 --> 00:56:05,480
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You didn't like her enough
to tell her the truth.</font>

432
00:56:05,640 --> 00:56:08,310
<font face="Comic Sans MS">6, 10 and 21.</font>

433
00:56:11,850 --> 00:56:13,930
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There's nothing to tell.</font>

434
00:56:14,270 --> 00:56:16,940
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How many times
have you told me that story?</font>

435
00:56:19,530 --> 00:56:20,700
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Your memory?</font>

436
00:56:22,320 --> 00:56:24,150
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The date carved beneath.</font>

437
00:56:24,950 --> 00:56:27,490
<font face="Comic Sans MS">6, 10 and 21.</font>

438
00:56:29,710 --> 00:56:31,170
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Coincidence?</font>

439
00:56:35,130 --> 00:56:37,970
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A dangerous coincidence.</font>

440
00:56:40,840 --> 00:56:43,670
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I always knew you were special.</font>

441
00:56:44,760 --> 00:56:46,510
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Maybe this is how.</font>

442
00:56:51,850 --> 00:56:53,850
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A child.</font>

443
00:56:54,020 --> 00:56:56,480
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Of woman born.</font>

444
00:56:57,570 --> 00:56:59,950
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Pushed into the world.</font>

445
00:57:00,950 --> 00:57:02,870
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wanted.</font>

446
00:57:03,740 --> 00:57:05,830
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Loved.</font>

447
00:57:08,240 --> 00:57:10,490
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, if it were true...</font>

448
00:57:11,540 --> 00:57:15,760
<font face="Comic Sans MS">...I'd be hunted for the rest of my life
by someone just like me.</font>

449
00:57:17,170 --> 00:57:19,800
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's okay to dream a little.</font>

450
00:57:20,130 --> 00:57:23,300
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Isn't it?
- Not if you're us.</font>

451
00:57:29,270 --> 00:57:30,770
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Stop.</font>

452
00:57:31,390 --> 00:57:35,810
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Put up 4847 and 2181 side-by-side.</font>

453
00:57:40,740 --> 00:57:43,580
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They're identical. Translate.</font>

454
00:57:46,910 --> 00:57:48,460
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A boy and a girl.</font>

455
00:57:50,410 --> 00:57:53,280
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- It's impossible.
- Why?</font>

456
00:57:54,830 --> 00:57:58,160
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Two people can't have identical DNA.</font>

457
00:57:59,170 --> 00:58:03,180
<font face="Comic Sans MS">One of these isn't real. It's a copy.</font>

458
00:58:07,680 --> 00:58:11,060
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They were both processed
at the Morrill Cole Orphanage.</font>

459
00:58:12,980 --> 00:58:15,440
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It says the girl died there.</font>

460
00:58:15,600 --> 00:58:17,730
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Genetic disorder.</font>

461
00:58:18,560 --> 00:58:20,940
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Galatians Syndrome.</font>

462
00:58:21,110 --> 00:58:22,950
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And the boy...</font>

463
00:58:24,860 --> 00:58:26,650
<font face="Comic Sans MS">...disappears.</font>

464
00:58:28,570 --> 00:58:30,400
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Where's the orphanage?</font>

465
00:58:32,830 --> 00:58:35,000
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You wanna go for a ride?</font>

466
00:59:50,780 --> 00:59:53,530
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, here we are.</font>

467
01:00:06,130 --> 01:00:07,330
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Buckle up.</font>

468
01:01:06,770 --> 01:01:07,850
<font face="Comic Sans MS">K?</font>

469
01:02:00,080 --> 01:02:03,460
<font face="Comic Sans MS">K? K?</font>

470
01:02:03,620 --> 01:02:06,870
<font face="Comic Sans MS">K? K? K?</font>

471
01:02:58,800 --> 01:02:59,920
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Stay back.</font>

472
01:03:15,400 --> 01:03:16,860
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Fire again.</font>

473
01:03:17,030 --> 01:03:18,990
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Fire again.</font>

474
01:03:20,320 --> 01:03:21,360
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Fire.</font>

475
01:03:33,000 --> 01:03:35,460
<font face="Comic Sans MS">200 feet to the east.</font>

476
01:03:37,130 --> 01:03:38,340
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Fire.</font>

477
01:03:40,510 --> 01:03:41,760
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Go north.</font>

478
01:03:43,970 --> 01:03:45,550
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Fire.</font>

479
01:03:46,310 --> 01:03:48,650
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Stop. 20 degrees east.</font>

480
01:03:51,060 --> 01:03:52,560
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Stop.</font>

481
01:03:52,730 --> 01:03:54,520
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Zoom in.</font>

482
01:03:55,690 --> 01:03:57,480
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Closer.</font>

483
01:04:00,490 --> 01:04:02,830
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, come on.</font>

484
01:04:03,490 --> 01:04:04,530
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Get up.</font>

485
01:04:05,410 --> 01:04:07,030
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Do your fucking job.</font>

486
01:04:08,460 --> 01:04:10,590
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Find the child.</font>

487
01:04:46,290 --> 01:04:48,040
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Watch the car.</font>

488
01:06:26,680 --> 01:06:30,730
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Every last piece, or I'll put you outside
where the sky is raining...</font>

489
01:06:30,890 --> 01:06:32,940
<font face="Comic Sans MS">...where it's raining fire!</font>

490
01:06:33,100 --> 01:06:34,810
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're in here to work.</font>

491
01:06:34,980 --> 01:06:38,240
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And if you're not working,
I don't need you.</font>

492
01:06:38,400 --> 01:06:40,820
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't need any of...</font>

493
01:06:42,990 --> 01:06:44,450
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hi.</font>

494
01:06:51,040 --> 01:06:53,830
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The nickel is for the colonial ships.</font>

495
01:06:54,000 --> 01:06:56,800
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Closest any of them
or any of us is gonna get...</font>

496
01:06:56,960 --> 01:07:00,220
<font face="Comic Sans MS">...to that grand life Off-world.</font>

497
01:07:00,710 --> 01:07:04,330
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And I encourage play, I do.
Keeps them occupied...</font>

498
01:07:04,510 --> 01:07:07,140
<font face="Comic Sans MS">...and it makes them nimble, right?</font>

499
01:07:07,510 --> 01:07:08,560
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But it's work.</font>

500
01:07:09,970 --> 01:07:13,510
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's work that molds them
into a child worth having.</font>

501
01:07:21,980 --> 01:07:23,900
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So come on, now.</font>

502
01:07:25,030 --> 01:07:27,370
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What sort do you have in mind?</font>

503
01:07:30,580 --> 01:07:34,120
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Because I got all kinds.</font>

504
01:07:36,250 --> 01:07:37,840
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Oh, no, no, no.
- I'm not buying.</font>

505
01:07:38,000 --> 01:07:41,090
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, no, no. This is just my game,
and I play it fair.</font>

506
01:07:41,250 --> 01:07:45,130
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No. No, I mean, bigger than you...</font>

507
01:07:47,470 --> 01:07:51,230
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Bigger than you have tried
to shut me down. Bigger than you.</font>

508
01:07:51,390 --> 01:07:54,270
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And they were men, at that.</font>

509
01:07:55,850 --> 01:07:58,440
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A little boy came through here
about 30 years back.</font>

510
01:07:59,440 --> 01:08:01,780
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I need to see your records.</font>

511
01:08:02,570 --> 01:08:05,030
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Legitimate placements,
private sales, everything.</font>

512
01:08:05,570 --> 01:08:07,490
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Don't keep records that far back.</font>

513
01:08:07,650 --> 01:08:09,650
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- You don't?
- I don't.</font>

514
01:08:11,700 --> 01:08:13,290
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sorry.</font>

515
01:08:13,450 --> 01:08:15,280
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Can't help you.</font>

516
01:08:18,120 --> 01:08:19,910
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- You can't?
- Nope.</font>

517
01:08:24,670 --> 01:08:25,960
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I think you can.</font>

518
01:08:28,380 --> 01:08:30,840
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I think someone like you
keeps a long memory.</font>

519
01:08:31,720 --> 01:08:33,810
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now you can tell me
what you remember...</font>

520
01:08:33,970 --> 01:08:36,260
<font face="Comic Sans MS">...or I can put a hole right here
and take a look.</font>

521
01:08:50,070 --> 01:08:53,610
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They were laughing and what was it
you said? What'd you say?</font>

522
01:09:11,800 --> 01:09:13,510
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Are you coming?</font>

523
01:09:24,110 --> 01:09:26,030
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Where is it?</font>

524
01:09:28,900 --> 01:09:30,650
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, God.</font>

525
01:09:35,450 --> 01:09:38,170
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Where, where, where?</font>

526
01:09:39,660 --> 01:09:42,580
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't see it. Here.</font>

527
01:09:50,720 --> 01:09:52,350
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's gone.</font>

528
01:09:54,590 --> 01:09:57,590
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's the entire year.</font>

529
01:09:58,930 --> 01:10:00,890
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I didn't do that.</font>

530
01:10:01,060 --> 01:10:02,980
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That wasn't me.</font>

531
01:10:06,060 --> 01:10:08,980
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I didn't. Wasn't me.</font>

532
01:14:43,470 --> 01:14:44,970
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I always told you.</font>

533
01:14:46,010 --> 01:14:47,930
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're special.</font>

534
01:14:51,520 --> 01:14:52,600
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Born.</font>

535
01:14:53,520 --> 01:14:55,320
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Not made.</font>

536
01:14:58,690 --> 01:15:00,950
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hidden with care.</font>

537
01:15:03,820 --> 01:15:06,290
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A real boy now.</font>

538
01:15:08,530 --> 01:15:11,070
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A real boy needs a real name.</font>

539
01:15:12,330 --> 01:15:13,920
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Joe.</font>

540
01:15:15,410 --> 01:15:16,450
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"Joe"?</font>

541
01:15:17,120 --> 01:15:19,960
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're too important for K.</font>

542
01:15:20,130 --> 01:15:22,720
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Your mother would've named you.</font>

543
01:15:25,470 --> 01:15:26,850
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Joe.</font>

544
01:15:29,050 --> 01:15:31,470
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Joe.
- Stop.</font>

545
01:15:37,770 --> 01:15:40,140
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How do I know
if a memory is an implant or not?</font>

546
01:15:44,490 --> 01:15:46,870
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Who makes the memories?</font>

547
01:16:18,060 --> 01:16:20,310
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Dr. Ana Stelline?</font>

548
01:16:23,770 --> 01:16:25,560
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A visitor.</font>

549
01:16:27,650 --> 01:16:29,440
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Is that okay?</font>

550
01:16:29,910 --> 01:16:30,950
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes.</font>

551
01:16:33,080 --> 01:16:35,250
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's just unusual.</font>

552
01:16:36,500 --> 01:16:40,630
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Nice to meet you, Officer KD6 -3.7.</font>

553
01:16:45,210 --> 01:16:49,290
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sorry.
It's a compromised immune system.</font>

554
01:16:49,470 --> 01:16:53,520
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A life of freedom,
so long as it's behind glass.</font>

555
01:16:53,930 --> 01:16:56,730
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Is that why you're not Off-world?
- Yes.</font>

556
01:16:57,430 --> 01:17:01,350
<font face="Comic Sans MS">My parents had our passes in pocket,
but I took sick.</font>

557
01:17:03,810 --> 01:17:06,690
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So it was a new life for me.</font>

558
01:17:06,860 --> 01:17:10,240
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And they put me in my cage...</font>

559
01:17:10,400 --> 01:17:13,490
<font face="Comic Sans MS">...filled it with everything they could
to keep me happy.</font>

560
01:17:13,660 --> 01:17:18,580
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Except company, of course.
And I was used to crowds.</font>

561
01:17:21,580 --> 01:17:22,950
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What can I help you with?</font>

562
01:17:24,380 --> 01:17:27,010
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thought you might be able to help me
with a case.</font>

563
01:17:28,300 --> 01:17:34,310
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, that's the most interesting thing
I've been offered to help with in ages.</font>

564
01:17:35,180 --> 01:17:38,270
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Do you mind if I work while you talk?</font>

565
01:17:39,180 --> 01:17:40,800
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Of course.</font>

566
01:17:47,570 --> 01:17:50,410
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I promise I hear every word.</font>

567
01:17:56,990 --> 01:17:59,820
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They say you're
the best memory-maker there is.</font>

568
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:02,040
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, then, they're kind.</font>

569
01:18:03,290 --> 01:18:05,700
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I love birthday parties.</font>

570
01:18:09,300 --> 01:18:11,350
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You work for Wallace?</font>

571
01:18:11,510 --> 01:18:15,020
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Subcontract. I'm one of his suppliers.</font>

572
01:18:15,390 --> 01:18:19,310
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He offered to buy me out,
but I take my freedom where I can find it.</font>

573
01:18:20,890 --> 01:18:22,180
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why are you so good?</font>

574
01:18:23,230 --> 01:18:25,280
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What makes your memories
so authentic?</font>

575
01:18:26,150 --> 01:18:29,320
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, there's a bit of every artist
in their work.</font>

576
01:18:30,740 --> 01:18:34,200
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But I was locked
in a sterile chamber at 8...</font>

577
01:18:35,530 --> 01:18:39,450
<font face="Comic Sans MS">...so if I wanted to see the world,
I had to imagine it.</font>

578
01:18:40,540 --> 01:18:44,090
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Got very good at imagining.</font>

579
01:18:45,040 --> 01:18:47,960
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wallace needs my talent
to maintain a stable product.</font>

580
01:18:49,920 --> 01:18:52,380
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I think it's only kind.</font>

581
01:18:53,630 --> 01:18:59,340
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Replicants live such hard lives,
made to do what we'd rather not.</font>

582
01:18:59,510 --> 01:19:00,800
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I can't help your future...</font>

583
01:19:00,970 --> 01:19:05,720
<font face="Comic Sans MS">...but I can give you good memories
to think back on and smile.</font>

584
01:19:05,900 --> 01:19:06,940
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's nice.</font>

585
01:19:07,360 --> 01:19:10,700
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's better than nice.
It feels authentic.</font>

586
01:19:10,860 --> 01:19:16,580
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And if you have authentic memories,
you have real human responses.</font>

587
01:19:17,030 --> 01:19:19,240
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wouldn't you agree?</font>

588
01:19:27,040 --> 01:19:31,120
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Are they all constructed,
or do you ever use ones that are real?</font>

589
01:19:35,470 --> 01:19:38,270
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's illegal to use real memories, officer.</font>

590
01:19:40,510 --> 01:19:42,340
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How can you tell the difference?</font>

591
01:19:42,520 --> 01:19:44,900
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Can you tell if something...</font>

592
01:19:46,230 --> 01:19:47,360
<font face="Comic Sans MS">...really happened?</font>

593
01:19:49,860 --> 01:19:52,450
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They all think it's about more detail.</font>

594
01:19:52,900 --> 01:19:55,730
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But that's not how memory works.</font>

595
01:19:56,110 --> 01:19:57,860
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We recall with our feelings.</font>

596
01:19:58,490 --> 01:20:02,160
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Anything real should be a mess.</font>

597
01:20:03,410 --> 01:20:05,450
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I can show you.</font>

598
01:20:06,790 --> 01:20:08,250
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sit.</font>

599
01:20:26,430 --> 01:20:31,390
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now, think about the memory
you want me to see.</font>

600
01:20:31,810 --> 01:20:34,850
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Not even that hard. Just picture it.</font>

601
01:20:35,320 --> 01:20:37,120
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Let it play.</font>

602
01:21:26,990 --> 01:21:29,530
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Someone lived this, yes.</font>

603
01:21:30,960 --> 01:21:32,880
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This happened.</font>

604
01:21:49,180 --> 01:21:51,260
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I know it's real.</font>

605
01:22:02,490 --> 01:22:04,410
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I know it's real.</font>

606
01:22:07,160 --> 01:22:11,000
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Goddamn it!</font>

607
01:22:54,710 --> 01:22:59,300
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Officer KD6 -3.7.
Madam is calling you in.</font>

608
01:22:59,460 --> 01:23:00,500
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're under arrest.</font>

609
01:23:00,670 --> 01:23:03,750
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Drop your gun and keep your hands
where I can see them.</font>

610
01:23:04,510 --> 01:23:05,560
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Cells.
- Cells.</font>

611
01:23:05,720 --> 01:23:08,100
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Have you ever been
in an institution? Cells.</font>

612
01:23:08,260 --> 01:23:12,640
<font face="Comic Sans MS">When you're not performing your duties,
do they keep you in a little box? Cells.</font>

613
01:23:12,810 --> 01:23:14,020
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Interlinked.
- Interlinked.</font>

614
01:23:14,190 --> 01:23:16,780
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What's it like to hold the hand
of someone you love?</font>

615
01:23:16,940 --> 01:23:19,740
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Interlinked.

- Within the cells interlinked.</font>

617
01:23:22,440 --> 01:23:26,360
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What's it like
to be filled with dread? Dreadfully.</font>

618
01:23:26,530 --> 01:23:29,360
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Do you like being separated
from other people? Distinct.</font>

619
01:23:29,530 --> 01:23:32,530
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Dreadfully distinct. Dark.
- Dreadfully distinct. Dark.</font>

620
01:23:32,700 --> 01:23:35,020
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Within cells interlinked.

625
01:23:49,390 --> 01:23:52,020
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're not even close to baseline.</font>

626
01:23:57,560 --> 01:23:59,770
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Out! And close the door.</font>

627
01:24:00,360 --> 01:24:02,490
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What the fuck is with you?</font>

628
01:24:02,650 --> 01:24:04,700
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I put you on a case.</font>

629
01:24:04,860 --> 01:24:07,110
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I impressed on you
the importance of that case...</font>

630
01:24:07,280 --> 01:24:11,120
<font face="Comic Sans MS">...and then we pick you up fucking
around outside an upgrade center?</font>

631
01:24:12,620 --> 01:24:17,000
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Scan said you didn't look like you
on the inside. Miles off your baseline.</font>

632
01:24:17,160 --> 01:24:20,160
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Do you know what that means?
- I found the kid.</font>

633
01:24:24,880 --> 01:24:27,920
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He was set up like a standard Replicant,
put on a service job.</font>

634
01:24:31,010 --> 01:24:33,470
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Even he didn't know who he was.</font>

635
01:24:35,220 --> 01:24:36,760
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- And?
- And it's done.</font>

636
01:24:36,930 --> 01:24:40,270
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- What does that mean, "it's done"?
- What you asked.</font>

637
01:24:41,560 --> 01:24:43,310
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's done.</font>

638
01:24:46,940 --> 01:24:48,570
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Fuck.</font>

639
01:24:50,820 --> 01:24:52,650
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You just stopped a bomb from going off.</font>

640
01:24:54,740 --> 01:24:56,490
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You did good.</font>

641
01:24:58,620 --> 01:25:00,790
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I can help you get out
of this station alive...</font>

642
01:25:00,960 --> 01:25:03,050
<font face="Comic Sans MS">...but you have 48 hours
to get back on track.</font>

643
01:25:03,880 --> 01:25:05,680
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Surrender your gun and badge.</font>

644
01:25:05,840 --> 01:25:09,260
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And your next baseline test
is out of my hands.</font>

645
01:25:10,890 --> 01:25:12,390
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thank you, madam.</font>

646
01:25:44,540 --> 01:25:46,290
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You were right.</font>

647
01:25:52,970 --> 01:25:54,810
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You were right about everything.</font>

648
01:26:23,580 --> 01:26:27,710
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thought you weren't interested,
worky man.</font>

649
01:26:30,010 --> 01:26:32,350
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You liked her. I could tell.</font>

650
01:26:34,890 --> 01:26:35,930
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's okay.</font>

651
01:26:37,350 --> 01:26:39,140
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She's real.</font>

652
01:26:41,020 --> 01:26:43,730
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I wanna be real for you.</font>

653
01:26:44,440 --> 01:26:46,280
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You are real for me.</font>

654
01:26:47,520 --> 01:26:48,980
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You have a special lady here.</font>

655
01:27:07,710 --> 01:27:08,750
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay.</font>

656
01:27:09,590 --> 01:27:11,220
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Let's do it.</font>

657
01:27:32,990 --> 01:27:34,490
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Look at you.</font>

658
01:27:34,650 --> 01:27:37,150
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Quiet now, I have to sync.</font>

659
01:30:33,000 --> 01:30:37,130
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Joi is anything you want her to be.</font>

660
01:30:38,300 --> 01:30:42,100
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Joi goes anywhere
you want her to go.</font>

661
01:31:11,450 --> 01:31:15,410
<font face="Comic Sans MS">99.9 percent detoxified water.</font>

662
01:31:44,820 --> 01:31:46,400
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's from a tree.</font>

663
01:31:46,570 --> 01:31:48,400
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm done with you.</font>

664
01:31:48,950 --> 01:31:50,790
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You can go now.</font>

665
01:32:02,130 --> 01:32:04,090
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Quiet now.</font>

666
01:32:04,260 --> 01:32:05,970
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I've been inside you.</font>

667
01:32:06,590 --> 01:32:09,210
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Not so much there as you think.</font>

668
01:32:28,070 --> 01:32:29,360
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Coffee?</font>

669
01:32:35,370 --> 01:32:37,830
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They'll be coming after me soon.</font>

670
01:32:46,380 --> 01:32:48,460
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm coming with you.</font>

671
01:32:48,890 --> 01:32:50,100
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But not like this.</font>

672
01:32:51,220 --> 01:32:56,220
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If they come here looking for you,
they'll have access to all my memories.</font>

673
01:32:56,390 --> 01:32:59,310
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You have to delete me
from the console.</font>

674
01:33:00,020 --> 01:33:01,850
<font face="Comic Sans MS">My present.</font>

675
01:33:03,570 --> 01:33:05,360
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Put me there.</font>

676
01:33:07,320 --> 01:33:09,280
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I can't do that.</font>

677
01:33:10,450 --> 01:33:12,250
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Think about it:</font>

678
01:33:12,950 --> 01:33:15,110
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If anything happens to this, that's it.</font>

679
01:33:16,580 --> 01:33:17,710
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're gone.</font>

680
01:33:18,330 --> 01:33:19,870
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes.</font>

681
01:33:20,960 --> 01:33:23,220
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Like a real girl.</font>

682
01:33:28,630 --> 01:33:30,340
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Please.</font>

683
01:33:33,220 --> 01:33:34,590
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Joe, please.</font>

684
01:33:36,100 --> 01:33:37,600
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I want this.</font>

685
01:33:41,770 --> 01:33:44,230
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But I can't do it myself.</font>

686
01:34:01,540 --> 01:34:02,870
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Break the antenna.</font>

687
01:34:43,370 --> 01:34:44,620
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't need a real horse.</font>

688
01:34:48,090 --> 01:34:53,220
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't need a real horse.
I just wanna find out where it's from.</font>

689
01:35:02,980 --> 01:35:04,820
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Radiation from a reactor?</font>

690
01:35:12,570 --> 01:35:14,030
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It matches a dirty bomb.</font>

691
01:35:22,580 --> 01:35:25,210
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There's only one place that dirty.</font>

692
01:35:26,670 --> 01:35:28,630
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Nobody lives there.</font>

693
01:36:19,260 --> 01:36:21,050
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Go to 5.</font>

694
01:36:21,640 --> 01:36:24,440
<font face="Comic Sans MS">4, 30 degrees to the left.</font>

695
01:36:26,310 --> 01:36:27,890
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Tilt up.</font>

696
01:36:30,400 --> 01:36:32,700
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Elevate to 400 feet.</font>

697
01:36:38,240 --> 01:36:40,330
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Radiation analysis.</font>

698
01:36:43,120 --> 01:36:44,830
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Move forward.</font>

699
01:36:51,500 --> 01:36:53,080
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Tilt up.</font>

700
01:36:53,250 --> 01:36:54,750
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Stop.</font>

701
01:36:56,720 --> 01:36:58,390
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Move forward.</font>

702
01:36:59,010 --> 01:37:00,850
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Go to 5.</font>

703
01:37:01,640 --> 01:37:03,520
<font face="Comic Sans MS">7, move forward.</font>

704
01:37:08,810 --> 01:37:10,470
<font face="Comic Sans MS">6.</font>

705
01:37:11,690 --> 01:37:13,200
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Stop.</font>

706
01:37:15,690 --> 01:37:17,400
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Go to 7.</font>

707
01:37:17,860 --> 01:37:19,400
<font face="Comic Sans MS">8.</font>

708
01:37:20,280 --> 01:37:21,860
<font face="Comic Sans MS">9.</font>

709
01:37:25,450 --> 01:37:27,450
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Heat analysis.</font>

710
01:37:35,090 --> 01:37:36,550
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Life.</font>

711
01:37:37,090 --> 01:37:38,800
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What is it?</font>

712
01:37:39,260 --> 01:37:41,600
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Guess we're about to find out.</font>

713
01:37:51,650 --> 01:37:53,320
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Too dark in here.</font>

714
01:37:56,320 --> 01:37:58,070
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I like him.</font>

715
01:37:58,820 --> 01:38:00,620
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He's a good boy.</font>

716
01:38:01,610 --> 01:38:03,360
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Where is he?</font>

717
01:38:09,460 --> 01:38:12,960
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I have no idea. He's off-duty.</font>

718
01:38:13,790 --> 01:38:15,040
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Check around.</font>

719
01:38:15,210 --> 01:38:16,960
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I checked...</font>

720
01:38:17,880 --> 01:38:20,210
<font face="Comic Sans MS">...anywhere a good boy might go.</font>

721
01:38:20,720 --> 01:38:22,560
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're too late.</font>

722
01:38:25,300 --> 01:38:27,090
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's gone.</font>

723
01:38:30,020 --> 01:38:31,900
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He destroyed it.</font>

724
01:38:34,020 --> 01:38:36,480
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Everything about it.</font>

725
01:38:36,650 --> 01:38:39,870
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, except for the box of bones
that you already took.</font>

726
01:38:44,120 --> 01:38:48,170
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Which, I'll wager, wasn't enough.
Here you are.</font>

727
01:38:55,380 --> 01:38:57,840
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You tiny thing.</font>

728
01:38:59,090 --> 01:39:02,970
<font face="Comic Sans MS">In the face of the fabulous new,
your only thought is to kill it?</font>

729
01:39:03,970 --> 01:39:06,850
<font face="Comic Sans MS">For fear of great change?</font>

730
01:39:07,510 --> 01:39:10,680
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You can't hold the tide with a broom.</font>

731
01:39:11,060 --> 01:39:12,940
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Except that I did.</font>

732
01:39:14,100 --> 01:39:15,600
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Where is he?!</font>

733
01:39:19,610 --> 01:39:21,450
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're so sure.</font>

734
01:39:22,610 --> 01:39:24,860
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Because he told you.</font>

735
01:39:25,030 --> 01:39:27,360
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Because we never lie.</font>

736
01:39:28,870 --> 01:39:32,170
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm gonna tell Mr. Wallace
you tried to shoot me first.</font>

737
01:39:32,830 --> 01:39:35,290
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So I had to kill you.</font>

738
01:39:39,340 --> 01:39:41,050
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Then do what you gotta do.</font>

739
01:39:42,550 --> 01:39:43,850
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Madam.</font>

740
01:40:15,960 --> 01:40:19,090
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Location: Officer KD6 -3.7.</font>

741
01:45:07,460 --> 01:45:12,720
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mightn't happen to have
a piece of cheese about you, now?</font>

742
01:45:13,300 --> 01:45:15,220
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Would you, boy?</font>

743
01:45:29,850 --> 01:45:31,140
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Treasure Island?</font>

744
01:45:38,240 --> 01:45:40,120
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He reads.</font>

745
01:45:40,990 --> 01:45:42,710
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's good.</font>

746
01:45:43,490 --> 01:45:45,200
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Me too.</font>

747
01:45:46,000 --> 01:45:49,670
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Not much else to do around here
at night anymore.</font>

748
01:45:52,000 --> 01:45:57,000
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Many is the night I dream of cheese...</font>

749
01:46:00,010 --> 01:46:03,810
<font face="Comic Sans MS">...toasted, mostly.</font>

750
01:46:06,640 --> 01:46:08,760
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What are you doing here?</font>

751
01:46:11,520 --> 01:46:12,730
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I heard the piano.</font>

752
01:46:15,150 --> 01:46:16,820
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Don't lie.</font>

753
01:46:17,860 --> 01:46:19,150
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's rude.</font>

754
01:46:21,450 --> 01:46:23,290
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're a cop.</font>

755
01:46:24,330 --> 01:46:26,750
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- I'm not here to take you in.
- Oh, yeah?</font>

756
01:46:30,000 --> 01:46:31,090
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Then, what?</font>

757
01:46:33,630 --> 01:46:35,630
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I just have some questions.</font>

758
01:46:36,380 --> 01:46:37,760
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What questions?</font>

759
01:46:55,900 --> 01:46:57,150
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Stay.</font>

760
01:49:30,720 --> 01:49:33,350
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Look, I don't wanna hurt you.</font>

761
01:49:33,970 --> 01:49:35,590
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But you're not making it easy.</font>

762
01:50:25,270 --> 01:50:26,980
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I like this song.</font>

763
01:50:37,450 --> 01:50:40,950
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We could keep at this,
or we could get a drink.</font>

764
01:50:53,180 --> 01:50:55,020
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'll take the drink.</font>

765
01:51:03,150 --> 01:51:05,110
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This is really something.</font>

766
01:51:05,270 --> 01:51:07,390
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The whole town was something.</font>

767
01:51:07,570 --> 01:51:09,410
<font face="Comic Sans MS">One time.</font>

768
01:51:11,030 --> 01:51:13,200
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Forget your troubles...</font>

769
01:51:14,160 --> 01:51:16,250
<font face="Comic Sans MS">...see a show...</font>

770
01:51:17,660 --> 01:51:19,790
<font face="Comic Sans MS">...gamble a little.</font>

771
01:51:22,080 --> 01:51:24,870
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Win some money, lose some money.</font>

772
01:51:25,500 --> 01:51:29,040
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They made money seem like candy.</font>

773
01:51:29,210 --> 01:51:31,130
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You like whiskey?</font>

774
01:51:31,300 --> 01:51:33,510
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I've got millions...</font>

775
01:51:33,680 --> 01:51:36,100
<font face="Comic Sans MS">...of bottles of whiskey.</font>

776
01:51:49,780 --> 01:51:50,820
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Here.</font>

777
01:51:52,200 --> 01:51:53,830
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Bleeding.</font>

778
01:52:06,330 --> 01:52:07,370
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Is it real?</font>

779
01:52:08,500 --> 01:52:10,000
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't know.</font>

780
01:52:10,170 --> 01:52:11,960
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ask him.</font>

781
01:52:28,270 --> 01:52:29,350
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You got a name?</font>

782
01:52:31,730 --> 01:52:33,230
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Officer KD6 -3.7...</font>

783
01:52:33,400 --> 01:52:36,190
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's not a name.
That's a serial number.</font>

784
01:52:39,080 --> 01:52:40,660
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All right.</font>

785
01:52:43,080 --> 01:52:44,540
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Joe.</font>

786
01:52:44,710 --> 01:52:46,920
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What do you want, Joe?</font>

787
01:52:47,960 --> 01:52:51,090
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- I wanna ask you some questions.
- Like what?</font>

788
01:52:57,430 --> 01:53:01,640
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Like what was her name,
the mother of your child?</font>

789
01:53:08,310 --> 01:53:09,810
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What was she like?</font>

790
01:53:20,990 --> 01:53:24,780
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- You two live here together?
- Too many questions.</font>

791
01:53:25,450 --> 01:53:27,030
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I had your job. I was good at it.</font>

792
01:53:27,750 --> 01:53:30,170
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- It was simpler then.
- Why you making it complicated?</font>

793
01:53:30,330 --> 01:53:32,660
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Why don't you answer the question?
- What question?</font>

794
01:53:32,840 --> 01:53:35,840
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I didn't figure you as one for bullshit.</font>

795
01:53:36,380 --> 01:53:37,800
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What's her name?</font>

796
01:53:51,400 --> 01:53:52,990
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Rachael.</font>

797
01:53:57,700 --> 01:53:59,870
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Her name was Rachael.</font>

798
01:54:03,740 --> 01:54:05,360
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What happened to the kid?</font>

799
01:54:08,620 --> 01:54:11,540
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Who put it in the orphanage?
Was it you?</font>

800
01:54:14,090 --> 01:54:15,630
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I was long gone by then.</font>

801
01:54:19,760 --> 01:54:22,220
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You didn't even meet your own kid?</font>

802
01:54:24,560 --> 01:54:26,190
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why?</font>

803
01:54:27,020 --> 01:54:28,650
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Because that was the plan.</font>

804
01:54:31,440 --> 01:54:36,070
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I showed them how to scramble
the records, cover their tracks.</font>

805
01:54:36,610 --> 01:54:39,580
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Everyone had a part.
Mine was to leave.</font>

806
01:54:40,860 --> 01:54:43,240
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Then the Blackout came,
paved over everything.</font>

807
01:54:43,410 --> 01:54:45,830
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Couldn't have found the child if I tried.</font>

808
01:54:45,990 --> 01:54:48,530
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Did you want to?
- Not really.</font>

809
01:54:49,460 --> 01:54:53,260
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Why not?
- Because we were being hunted.</font>

810
01:54:53,420 --> 01:54:55,760
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I didn't want our child found...</font>

811
01:54:56,250 --> 01:54:59,790
<font face="Comic Sans MS">...taken apart, dissected.</font>

812
01:55:03,300 --> 01:55:06,510
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sometimes, to love someone...</font>

813
01:55:08,270 --> 01:55:10,560
<font face="Comic Sans MS">...you gotta be a stranger.</font>

814
01:55:31,370 --> 01:55:33,200
<font face="Comic Sans MS">To strangers.</font>

815
01:57:44,840 --> 01:57:46,470
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What'd you do?</font>

816
01:57:46,630 --> 01:57:48,250
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Who'd you bring?</font>

817
01:57:50,090 --> 01:57:52,840
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- No one.
- Oh, yeah?</font>

818
01:57:58,140 --> 01:57:59,470
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Target locked.</font>

819
01:58:02,020 --> 01:58:03,140
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They know you're here.</font>

820
01:58:05,190 --> 01:58:07,110
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I came alone.</font>

821
02:00:13,780 --> 02:00:14,870
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Bad dog.</font>

822
02:00:32,760 --> 02:00:34,180
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Stop.</font>

823
02:00:50,190 --> 02:00:52,350
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I do hope you're satisfied
with our product.</font>

824
02:00:53,440 --> 02:00:55,150
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I love...</font>

825
02:04:08,720 --> 02:04:13,350
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, there's someone
who wants to meet you.</font>

826
02:04:14,650 --> 02:04:16,030
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You can trust us.</font>

827
02:04:24,450 --> 02:04:27,370
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You must want me to look up
and to the left.</font>

828
02:04:33,120 --> 02:04:34,330
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This is Freysa.</font>

829
02:04:35,460 --> 02:04:37,590
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She fought with Sapper on Calantha.</font>

830
02:04:37,750 --> 02:04:39,670
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I recognize you.</font>

831
02:04:41,630 --> 02:04:43,590
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Did you help him hide the child?</font>

832
02:04:45,800 --> 02:04:47,760
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I was there.</font>

833
02:04:51,180 --> 02:04:53,720
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I saw a miracle delivered.</font>

834
02:04:54,600 --> 02:04:58,140
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A perfect little face crying up at me.</font>

835
02:04:58,520 --> 02:05:00,890
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mad as thunder.</font>

836
02:05:13,750 --> 02:05:15,670
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Were you with her?</font>

837
02:05:17,290 --> 02:05:18,750
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Rachael?</font>

838
02:05:18,920 --> 02:05:21,550
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I held her as she died.</font>

839
02:05:22,510 --> 02:05:27,180
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We hid the child
and made a vow to keep our secret.</font>

840
02:05:27,340 --> 02:05:30,130
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's why Sapper let you kill him.</font>

841
02:05:31,100 --> 02:05:37,820
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I knew that baby meant
we are more than just slaves.</font>

842
02:05:38,350 --> 02:05:40,980
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If a baby can come from one of us...</font>

843
02:05:41,150 --> 02:05:44,320
<font face="Comic Sans MS">...we are our own masters.</font>

844
02:05:44,490 --> 02:05:47,160
<font face="Comic Sans MS">More human than humans.</font>

845
02:05:49,030 --> 02:05:50,780
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A revolution is coming.</font>

846
02:05:51,330 --> 02:05:53,870
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And we're building an army.</font>

847
02:05:54,750 --> 02:05:56,750
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I want to free our people.</font>

848
02:06:05,260 --> 02:06:06,930
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If you want to be free...</font>

849
02:06:07,630 --> 02:06:09,380
<font face="Comic Sans MS">...join us.</font>

850
02:06:14,310 --> 02:06:17,110
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Deckard, Sapper, you, me...</font>

851
02:06:17,270 --> 02:06:21,240
<font face="Comic Sans MS">...our lives mean nothing
next to a storm that's coming.</font>

852
02:06:22,020 --> 02:06:26,690
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Dying for the right cause
is the most human thing we can do.</font>

853
02:06:29,320 --> 02:06:31,820
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You led Wallace to Deckard.</font>

854
02:06:32,200 --> 02:06:36,540
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You cannot allow Deckard
to lead Wallace to me.</font>

855
02:06:36,700 --> 02:06:38,580
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You must kill Deckard.</font>

856
02:06:48,050 --> 02:06:51,520
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Deckard only wanted
his baby to be safe.</font>

857
02:06:51,680 --> 02:06:52,730
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And she is.</font>

858
02:06:55,390 --> 02:06:58,810
<font face="Comic Sans MS">When the time comes,
I will show her to the world...</font>

859
02:06:58,980 --> 02:07:01,110
<font face="Comic Sans MS">...and she will lead our army.</font>

860
02:07:01,270 --> 02:07:02,680
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"She"?</font>

861
02:07:02,860 --> 02:07:04,740
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Of course.</font>

862
02:07:04,900 --> 02:07:07,240
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Rachael had a daughter.</font>

863
02:07:08,240 --> 02:07:11,620
<font face="Comic Sans MS">With my own eyes, I saw her come.</font>

864
02:07:12,110 --> 02:07:14,950
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I dressed her in blue
when it was time for her to go.</font>

865
02:07:15,120 --> 02:07:17,210
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It was a boy that you hid.</font>

866
02:07:19,410 --> 02:07:22,910
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That is just a piece of the puzzle.</font>

867
02:07:39,350 --> 02:07:42,360
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You imagined it was you?</font>

868
02:07:45,110 --> 02:07:46,700
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You did.</font>

869
02:07:47,190 --> 02:07:48,770
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You did.</font>

870
02:07:51,400 --> 02:07:54,110
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We all wish it was us.</font>

871
02:07:55,200 --> 02:07:57,660
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's why we believe.</font>

872
02:08:13,630 --> 02:08:15,510
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Someone lived this, yes.</font>

873
02:08:17,930 --> 02:08:22,550
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I showed them how to scramble
the records, cover their tracks.</font>

874
02:08:22,730 --> 02:08:25,110
<font face="Comic Sans MS">With my own eyes, I saw her come.</font>

875
02:08:26,860 --> 02:08:30,910
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I dressed her in blue
when it was time for her to go.</font>

876
02:08:31,280 --> 02:08:33,620
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There's a bit of every
artist in their work.</font>

877
02:09:12,030 --> 02:09:14,780
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Always jumping, that one.</font>

878
02:09:15,360 --> 02:09:18,530
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Never a thought of what to do
if it made land.</font>

879
02:09:19,530 --> 02:09:24,660
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All the courage in the world
cannot alter fact.</font>

880
02:09:28,920 --> 02:09:33,640
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I have wanted to meet you
for so very long.</font>

881
02:09:52,570 --> 02:09:55,570
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You are a wonder to me, Mr. Deckard.</font>

882
02:10:01,080 --> 02:10:02,660
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I had the lock.</font>

883
02:10:04,450 --> 02:10:06,830
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I found the key.</font>

884
02:10:08,000 --> 02:10:13,220
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yet the pins do not align.
The door remains locked.</font>

885
02:10:15,260 --> 02:10:19,310
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I need the specimen to reach it,
Mr. Deckard.</font>

886
02:10:22,430 --> 02:10:24,140
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The child.</font>

887
02:10:25,310 --> 02:10:26,810
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I need the child.</font>

888
02:10:28,390 --> 02:10:30,890
<font face="Comic Sans MS">To teach them all to fly.</font>

889
02:10:39,320 --> 02:10:43,610
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And God remembered Rachel...</font>

890
02:10:45,200 --> 02:10:48,830
<font face="Comic Sans MS">...heeded her and opened her womb.</font>

891
02:10:50,420 --> 02:10:52,460
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Do you like our owl?</font>

892
02:10:54,920 --> 02:10:56,630
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's artificial?</font>

893
02:10:57,630 --> 02:10:59,750
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Of course it is.</font>

894
02:11:01,010 --> 02:11:02,930
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Must be expensive.</font>

895
02:11:04,510 --> 02:11:07,180
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Very. I'm Rachael.</font>

896
02:11:08,180 --> 02:11:09,810
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Deckard.</font>

897
02:11:21,660 --> 02:11:23,750
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Is it the same...</font>

898
02:11:24,740 --> 02:11:27,700
<font face="Comic Sans MS">...now, as then...</font>

899
02:11:29,870 --> 02:11:32,120
<font face="Comic Sans MS">...the moment you met her?</font>

900
02:11:41,800 --> 02:11:44,800
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All these years
you looked back on that day...</font>

901
02:11:44,970 --> 02:11:48,840
<font face="Comic Sans MS">...drunk on the memory
of its perfection.</font>

902
02:11:51,520 --> 02:11:53,690
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How shiny her lips.</font>

903
02:11:53,850 --> 02:11:56,890
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How instant your connection.</font>

904
02:11:59,690 --> 02:12:04,690
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Did it never occur to you that's why
you were summoned in the first place?</font>

905
02:12:06,080 --> 02:12:12,130
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Designed to do nothing short
of fall for her right then and there.</font>

906
02:12:13,830 --> 02:12:19,710
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All to make that single perfect specimen.</font>

907
02:12:22,470 --> 02:12:25,930
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That is, if you were designed.</font>

908
02:12:26,800 --> 02:12:28,380
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Love...</font>

909
02:12:28,560 --> 02:12:31,520
<font face="Comic Sans MS">...or mathematical precision.</font>

910
02:12:37,020 --> 02:12:38,560
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes.</font>

911
02:12:39,320 --> 02:12:40,990
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No.</font>

912
02:12:45,280 --> 02:12:47,610
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I know what's real.</font>

913
02:13:11,310 --> 02:13:14,650
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It was very clever
to keep yourself empty of information...</font>

914
02:13:14,810 --> 02:13:18,980
<font face="Comic Sans MS">...and all it cost you was everything.</font>

915
02:13:22,610 --> 02:13:24,320
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But you can still help me.</font>

916
02:13:26,200 --> 02:13:29,910
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You had help in the hiding.</font>

917
02:13:31,740 --> 02:13:34,030
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Where did they go?</font>

918
02:13:35,330 --> 02:13:37,240
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I know you know something.</font>

919
02:13:38,500 --> 02:13:40,290
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Help me...</font>

920
02:13:40,920 --> 02:13:44,970
<font face="Comic Sans MS">...and very, very good things
can come to you.</font>

921
02:13:50,140 --> 02:13:52,480
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You don't have children...</font>

922
02:13:55,600 --> 02:13:56,720
<font face="Comic Sans MS">...do you?</font>

923
02:13:57,520 --> 02:14:00,530
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, I have millions.</font>

924
02:14:02,230 --> 02:14:05,560
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You think I have nothing to offer but pain.</font>

925
02:14:05,740 --> 02:14:08,080
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Only I know...</font>

926
02:14:08,820 --> 02:14:10,650
<font face="Comic Sans MS">...you love pain.</font>

927
02:14:11,870 --> 02:14:16,790
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Pain reminds you
the joy you felt was real.</font>

928
02:14:18,370 --> 02:14:20,410
<font face="Comic Sans MS">More joy, then.</font>

929
02:14:26,470 --> 02:14:28,600
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Do not be afraid.</font>

930
02:14:43,360 --> 02:14:44,910
<font face="Comic Sans MS">An angel...</font>

931
02:14:46,070 --> 02:14:47,200
<font face="Comic Sans MS">...made again.</font>

932
02:14:51,700 --> 02:14:53,370
<font face="Comic Sans MS">For you.</font>

933
02:15:27,400 --> 02:15:29,400
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Did you miss me?</font>

934
02:15:47,170 --> 02:15:49,130
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Don't you love me?</font>

935
02:16:07,860 --> 02:16:09,240
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Her eyes were green.</font>

936
02:16:27,130 --> 02:16:29,390
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Off-world...</font>

937
02:16:29,550 --> 02:16:33,310
<font face="Comic Sans MS">...I have everything I need
to make you talk.</font>

938
02:16:34,680 --> 02:16:37,850
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You do not know what pain is yet.</font>

939
02:16:38,930 --> 02:16:40,840
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You will learn.</font>

940
02:16:52,650 --> 02:16:54,690
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hello, handsome.</font>

941
02:17:11,460 --> 02:17:13,920
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What a day.</font>

942
02:17:17,760 --> 02:17:19,380
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You look lonely.</font>

943
02:17:20,680 --> 02:17:23,140
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I can fix that.</font>

944
02:17:26,060 --> 02:17:28,680
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You look like a good joe.</font>

945
02:18:04,180 --> 02:18:09,980
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Dying for the right cause
is the most human thing we can do.</font>

946
02:18:12,320 --> 02:18:15,280
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Because you've never seen a miracle.</font>

947
02:18:53,440 --> 02:18:56,610
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're entering Los Angeles Airport
restricted airspace.</font>

948
02:18:56,780 --> 02:18:59,080
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Confirm your identity.</font>

949
02:18:59,240 --> 02:19:02,120
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Transport S-14-4-XD. Confirmed.</font>

950
02:19:02,280 --> 02:19:03,990
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Space, this is 0-6.</font>

951
02:19:04,160 --> 02:19:06,880
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Outbound departure, route 0-3-0.</font>

952
02:19:07,040 --> 02:19:08,960
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Where are we going?</font>

953
02:19:09,710 --> 02:19:11,340
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Home.</font>

954
02:20:06,260 --> 02:20:08,010
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Drive two down.</font>

955
02:20:08,180 --> 02:20:10,260
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Backup engaged.</font>

956
02:20:11,230 --> 02:20:12,270
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Warning.</font>

957
02:20:12,440 --> 02:20:15,240
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Can we make it?
- We're too low!</font>

958
02:20:15,400 --> 02:20:16,530
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Take us back!</font>

959
02:21:05,700 --> 02:21:06,750
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Get us up.</font>

960
02:21:31,890 --> 02:21:33,140
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Open the door.</font>

961
02:23:26,340 --> 02:23:28,430
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm the best one.</font>

962
02:24:08,920 --> 02:24:11,050
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Off-world is waiting.</font>

963
02:26:24,140 --> 02:26:27,180
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Joe. Joe!</font>

964
02:26:36,820 --> 02:26:38,530
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Joe!</font>

965
02:27:17,490 --> 02:27:19,700
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You should have let me die out there.</font>

966
02:27:20,700 --> 02:27:22,330
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You did.</font>

967
02:27:26,000 --> 02:27:28,130
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You drowned out there.</font>

968
02:27:33,500 --> 02:27:35,290
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're free to meet your daughter now.</font>

969
02:29:01,130 --> 02:29:03,800
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All the best memories are hers.</font>

970
02:29:12,730 --> 02:29:14,150
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why?</font>

971
02:29:16,690 --> 02:29:18,610
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Who am I to you?</font>

972
02:29:27,870 --> 02:29:29,870
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Go meet your daughter.</font>

973
02:29:35,790 --> 02:29:37,250
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You okay?</font>

974
02:32:13,530 --> 02:32:15,360
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Just a moment.</font>

975
02:32:17,620 --> 02:32:19,000
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Beautiful, isn't it?</font>
